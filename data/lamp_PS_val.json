The weight of this relationship bore heavily on Jacob's conscience, rooted in the shared history of his grandfather Isaac and great-uncle Benny, Holocaust survivors whose means of survival remained shrouded in unspoken darkness, their separate paths leading to America and Israel respectively, where they built parallel lives that would forever be connected yet distinctly apart. The family tree branched through their sons, Shlomo and Irv, eventually reaching Jacob and Tamir, cousins who inherited not just blood ties but also the unspoken obligation to maintain a connection neither fully embraced nor completely rejected. Their family visits played out like carefully choreographed performances, each side acutely aware of their differences while maintaining a veneer of familial warmth, their interactions peppered with subtle judgments and cultural misunderstandings that neither party could fully bridge. The death of Isaac marked a turning point, bringing Tamir to American soil for the funeral, where the cousins found themselves sharing beers and unprecedented honesty about their grandfather's life - a life that Jacob now viewed through the dual lens of shame: shame for accepting the monotony that had characterized Isaac's existence, and shame for presuming to judge it. The conversation with Tamir that night exposed the superficiality of their relationship, leading Jacob to a painful recognition of his own role in maintaining this distance, despite his performative use of \"our\" when referring to his Israeli relatives. The realization that he had allowed this meaningful connection to wither into mere obligation weighed heavily on Jacob, who found himself caught between his instinct to maintain familial bonds and his discomfort with too close an association, a contradiction that seemed to mirror the complex dynamics between their respective nations and cultures. This internal struggle manifested in his daily life through small gestures and word choices, like his insistence on using \"our\" when referring to Tamir's family, a linguistic choice that seemed to compensate for the actual distance he helped maintain. The relationship between the cousins, much like the branching paths their grandfathers took after the war, represented both the endurance and fragility of family bonds across geographical, cultural, and ideological divides, with Jacob's regret serving as a poignant reminder of the opportunities lost in allowing these connections to fade into mere formality. Their shared heritage, marked by their grandfathers' survival and subsequent divergent paths, created an unspoken bond that neither cousin fully embraced nor could entirely ignore, leaving them in a perpetual state of connection and disconnection, much like their respective nations. The complexity of their relationship was further complicated by the unspoken expectations and obligations that came with their shared history, creating a dynamic where both felt compelled to maintain contact while simultaneously keeping each other at arm's length, their interactions marked by a peculiar mix of familiarity and distance that neither seemed able to bridge completely. This tension between obligation and genuine connection, between shared history and divergent presents, between the desire to maintain family ties and the comfort of distance, all came to a head during that post-funeral conversation, leaving Jacob with a profound sense of loss - not just for his grandfather, but for the deeper connection with Tamir that he had never fully pursued, a realization that came too late to easily remedy but not too late to acknowledge",

    "paragraph1": "When a whisper reached him, the faintest murmur from one of his top, inner-circle speakers\u2019-bureau doctors, that a certain Indian movie actress turned American daytime-TV superstar might appreciate a house call, Dr. R. K. Smile actually laughed out loud and clapped his hands. \u201cArr\u00e9, kya baat! \u201d he cried out in the privacy of his home office. \u201cWhoa, what a thing!\u201d Because now, if it all worked out as he hoped, he just might be able to make his poor relation\u2019s impossible dream come true, if only for a moment, before the tragic inevitable occurred. He might find it in his power, and in his heart, to bring fantasy-besotted old Quichotte face to face with his lady love. Quichotte, arriving in Manhattan at the end of a long journey\u2014his quest toward Miss Salma R. had led him through Tulsa, Oklahoma; Beautiful, Kansas; Cleveland, Ohio; Bunyan, Pennsylvania; Chaucer, New Jersey; and Huckleberry, New York\u2014felt like a snail coming out of its shell. Here was bustle and thrum, hustle and flow, everything he had spent the better part of his life recoiling from, concealing himself instead in the heart of the country, leading a small life among other small lives. Now he was back in the big room, at the high rollers\u2019 table, betting the farm on love. He found accommodation in the Blue Yorker hotel, which stood conveniently just a couple of blocks from the tunnel exit, a hundred and three dollars a night, including parking, excellent value, no I.D. demanded, no questions asked, cash money required in advance, and only when he entered his Oriental Delights-themed room did he understand that he was in one of the city\u2019s numerous no-tell motels, with six free porno channels on the TV. There was adjustable mood lighting. There were strategically placed mirrors. The night was full of noises, of pleasure, pain, and painful pleasure. It was hard to sleep soundly. But, in the days that followed, Quichotte was pensive and sad. He stayed in his room watching TV (not the porno channels). He did not go to stand outside Miss Salma R.\u2019s apartment building, or outside her office slash studio, in the hope of glimpsing the woman whose heart he had come to the city to win. \u201cThere is still much to be done before I am worthy of her presence,\u201d he told himself, and then, seemingly, did nothing. The path to the Beloved was closed, even when he was so near to her, and he did not know how to open it. Then, unexpectedly, he received a mysterious series of texts from his cousin and erstwhile employer, asking where he was, seeming unsurprised when he confirmed that he was in New York, and requesting an immediate meeting by an old red-oak tree near the Hans Christian Andersen statue in Central Park. He went to the Park and Dr. Smile was waiting for him. Hat, coat, small leather attach\u00e9 case, like an Old World medico doing his rounds. But there had been a transformation in his state of mind. He was no longer the warm and gleeful man Quichotte remembered. \u201cBest of cousins!\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s walk a little,\u201d Dr. Smile said. His mood, Quichotte noted with regret, was foul. \u201cThere has been an event today in Atlanta,\u201d Dr. Smile said as they walked in the general direction of the boathouse. \u201cA shocking event, may I say. An offensive event concerning my good wife.\u201d \u201cMrs. Happy?\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cThat is indeed unexpected and woeful news! I hope she has not met with a misfortune?\u201d \u201c \u2018Misfortune\u2019 is too mild a word,\u201d Dr. Smile said grimly. \u201cI will tell you what has happened. I have a need to tell someone, and I believe I can talk to you\u2014because, to put it bluntly, you are nobody, you know nobody, so you can tell nobody who is anybody, and, plus, you are borderline simple as well.\u201d This remark\u2014its tone very unlike the kind manner with which his cousin had always spoken to him\u2014struck Quichotte as harsh and, in part, incorrect. \u201cBut everybody is somebody,\u201d he replied mildly. \u201cAlthough the language can be confusing. When we say that \u2018nobody is here,\u2019 we mean in fact that \u2018somebody\u2019 is \u2018not here.\u2019 If I am here, I can\u2019t be nobody. Look,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cThere, there, there. Somebody, somebody, somebody.\u201d He pointed at himself. \u201cSomebody,\u201d he concluded with pride. Dr. Smile heard him out with growing impatience. \u201cI repeat,\u201d he said, \u201cborderline simple. And I don\u2019t have time for small talk. I have something to say today about the injustice of the world toward a man who is only trying to do his best. And also toward his lady wife, an innocent bystander, Happy by name, happy by nature. She was with her lady friends,\u201d Dr. Smile continued. \u201cA circle of like-minded philanthropical ladies, meeting, as was their habit, at Dr. Bombay\u2019s Underwater Tea Party in Candler Park.\u201d \u201cUnderwater?\u201d Quichotte was lost now. \u201cThis is a name only,\u201d Dr. Smile said sharply. \u201cThis is a tea place, not a submarine.\u201d Quichotte inclined his head. \u201cThen they came in, how do they say in America? Like gangbusters.\u201d \u201cThe like-minded philanthropical ladies?\u201d \u201cThe forces of",
    "paragraph2": "As Dr. R. K. Smile sat in his opulent office, surrounded by the trappings of a life built on questionable ethics, he couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement at the prospect of a new opportunity. A tip had come his way, whispering of a chance to meet the famous actress, Miss Salma R., a woman whose beauty and talent had captivated the hearts of millions, including that of his poor relation, Quichotte. Dr. Smile's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he thought of the potential benefits this meeting could bring, not just for himself, but for Quichotte, who had been pining for the actress for what felt like an eternity. Quichotte, a man with a heart full of love and a soul full of determination, had traveled across the vast expanse of the United States, from the sun-kissed deserts of the west to the concrete jungle of New York, all in the hopes of catching a glimpse of his beloved Miss Salma R. Now, as he sat in his cramped, dingy hotel room, surrounded by the detritus of a life on the move, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unworthiness, a nagging doubt that he was somehow less than deserving of the actress's attention. It was a feeling that had become all too familiar for Quichotte, one that he had grown accustomed to, but never truly accepted. And so, when a mysterious message arrived from Dr. Smile, requesting a meeting in the heart of Central Park, Quichotte's curiosity was piqued. What could Dr. Smile want with him? What news could he possibly have to share? The questions swirled in Quichotte's mind like a maelstrom, pulling him in with an otherworldly force. As he made his way through the crowded streets of Manhattan, the towering skyscrapers looming above him like giants, Quichotte couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to change in ways he couldn't yet imagine. The meeting with Dr. Smile was a revelation, a glimpse into a world that Quichotte had only ever caught glimpses of. Dr. Smile, resplendent in his tailored suit and gleaming gold watch, seemed every inch the confident, self-assured man that Quichotte had always known him to be. But as they walked through the park, the sounds of the city fading into the background, Dr. Smile's mask began to slip, revealing a man troubled by the weight of his own making. He spoke of the recent raid on his wife's social gathering, the accusations of corruption that had been leveled against him, and the frustration that had been building inside him like a powder keg. \"I've enriched so many people, Quichotte,\" Dr. Smile exclaimed, his voice rising in indignation. \"I've given them the keys to the kingdom, and this is how they repay me? By betraying me, by turning on me like a pack of wolves?\" Quichotte listened, entranced, as Dr. Smile defended his actions, dismissing the allegations of corruption as nothing more than a cultural norm. \"This is how business is done, Quichotte,\" he said, his eyes glinting with a mixture of defiance and desperation. \"This is how the game is played. And I've played it better than most.\" Despite his bravado, however, Dr. Smile was clearly a man on the ropes, his confidence shaken by the recent turn of events. And yet, even as he spoke of his troubles, there was a hint of something else, a sense that he was holding something back, something",

Smile actually laughed out loud and clapped his hands. \u201cArr\u00e9, kya baat! \u201d he cried out in the privacy of his home office. \u201cWhoa, what a thing!\u201d Because now, if it all worked out as he hoped, he just might be able to make his poor relation\u2019s impossible dream come true, if only for a moment, before the tragic inevitable occurred. He might find it in his power, and in his heart, to bring fantasy-besotted old Quichotte face to face with his lady love. Quichotte, arriving in Manhattan at the end of a long journey\u2014his quest toward Miss Salma R. had led him through Tulsa, Oklahoma; Beautiful, Kansas; Cleveland, Ohio; Bunyan, Pennsylvania; Chaucer, New Jersey; and Huckleberry, New York\u2014felt like a snail coming out of its shell. Here was bustle and thrum, hustle and flow, everything he had spent the better part of his life recoiling from, concealing himself instead in the heart of the country, leading a small life among other small lives. Now he was back in the big room, at the high rollers\u2019 table, betting the farm on love. He found accommodation in the Blue Yorker hotel, which stood conveniently just a couple of blocks from the tunnel exit, a hundred and three dollars a night, including parking, excellent value, no I.D. demanded, no questions asked, cash money required in advance, and only when he entered his Oriental Delights-themed room did he understand that he was in one of the city\u2019s numerous no-tell motels, with six free porno channels on the TV. There was adjustable mood lighting. There were strategically placed mirrors. The night was full of noises, of pleasure, pain, and painful pleasure. It was hard to sleep soundly. But, in the days that followed, Quichotte was pensive and sad. He stayed in his room watching TV (not the porno channels). He did not go to stand outside Miss Salma R.\u2019s apartment building, or outside her office slash studio, in the hope of glimpsing the woman whose heart he had come to the city to win. \u201cThere is still much to be done before I am worthy of her presence,\u201d he told himself, and then, seemingly, did nothing. The path to the Beloved was closed, even when he was so near to her, and he did not know how to open it. Then, unexpectedly, he received a mysterious series of texts from his cousin and erstwhile employer, asking where he was, seeming unsurprised when he confirmed that he was in New York, and requesting an immediate meeting by an old red-oak tree near the Hans Christian Andersen statue in Central Park. He went to the Park and Dr. Smile was waiting for him. Hat, coat, small leather attach\u00e9 case, like an Old World medico doing his rounds. But there had been a transformation in his state of mind. He was no longer the warm and gleeful man Quichotte remembered. \u201cBest of cousins!\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s walk a little,\u201d Dr. Smile said. His mood, Quichotte noted with regret, was foul. \u201cThere has been an event today in Atlanta,\u201d Dr. Smile said as they walked in the general direction of the boathouse. \u201cA shocking event, may I say. An offensive event concerning my good wife.\u201d \u201cMrs. Happy?\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cThat is indeed unexpected and woeful news! I hope she has not met with a misfortune?\u201d \u201c \u2018Misfortune\u2019 is too mild a word,\u201d Dr. Smile said grimly. \u201cI will tell you what has happened. I have a need to tell someone, and I believe I can talk to you\u2014because, to put it bluntly, you are nobody, you know nobody, so you can tell nobody who is anybody, and, plus, you are borderline simple as well.\u201d This remark\u2014its tone very unlike the kind manner with which his cousin had always spoken to him\u2014struck Quichotte as harsh and, in part, incorrect. \u201cBut everybody is somebody,\u201d he replied mildly. \u201cAlthough the language can be confusing. When we say that \u2018nobody is here,\u2019 we mean in fact that \u2018somebody\u2019 is \u2018not here.\u2019 If I am here, I can\u2019t be nobody. Look,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cThere, there, there. Somebody, somebody, somebody.\u201d He pointed at himself. \u201cSomebody,\u201d he concluded with pride. Dr. Smile heard him out with growing impatience. \u201cI repeat,\u201d he said, \u201cborderline simple. And I don\u2019t have time for small talk. I have something to say today about the injustice of the world toward a man who is only trying to do his best. And also toward his lady wife, an innocent bystander, Happy by name, happy by nature. She was with her lady friends,\u201d Dr. Smile continued. \u201cA circle of like-minded philanthropical ladies, meeting, as was their habit, at Dr. Bombay\u2019s Underwater Tea Party in Candler Park.\u201d \u201cUnderwater?\u201d Quichotte was lost now. \u201cThis is a name only,\u201d Dr. Smile said sharply. \u201cThis is a tea place, not a submarine.\u201d Quichotte inclined his head. \u201cThen they came in, how do they say in America? Like gangbusters.\u201d \u201cThe like-minded philanthropical ladies?\u201d \u201cThe forces of\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs Dr. R. K. Smile sat in his opulent office, surrounded by the trappings of a life built on questionable ethics, he couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement at the prospect of a new opportunity. A tip had come his way, whispering of a chance to meet the famous actress, Miss Salma R., a woman whose beauty and talent had captivated the hearts of millions, including that of his poor relation, Quichotte. Dr. Smile's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he thought of the potential benefits this meeting could bring, not just for himself, but for Quichotte, who had been pining for the actress for what felt like an eternity. Quichotte, a man with a heart full of love and a soul full of determination, had traveled across the vast expanse of the United States, from the sun-kissed deserts of the west to the concrete jungle of New York, all in the hopes of catching a glimpse of his beloved Miss Salma R. Now, as he sat in his cramped, dingy hotel room, surrounded by the detritus of a life on the move, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unworthiness, a nagging doubt that he was somehow less than deserving of the actress's attention. It was a feeling that had become all too familiar for Quichotte, one that he had grown accustomed to, but never truly accepted. And so, when a mysterious message arrived from Dr. Smile, requesting a meeting in the heart of Central Park, Quichotte's curiosity was piqued. What could Dr. Smile want with him? What news could he possibly have to share? The questions swirled in Quichotte's mind like a maelstrom, pulling him in with an otherworldly force. As he made his way through the crowded streets of Manhattan, the towering skyscrapers looming above him like giants, Quichotte couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to change in ways he couldn't yet imagine. The meeting with Dr. Smile was a revelation, a glimpse into a world that Quichotte had only ever caught glimpses of. Dr. Smile, resplendent in his tailored suit and gleaming gold watch, seemed every inch the confident, self-assured man that Quichotte had always known him to be. But as they walked through the park, the sounds of the city fading into the background, Dr. Smile's mask began to slip, revealing a man troubled by the weight of his own making. He spoke of the recent raid on his wife's social gathering, the accusations of corruption that had been leveled against him, and the frustration that had been building inside him like a powder keg. \"I've enriched so many people, Quichotte,\" Dr. Smile exclaimed, his voice rising in indignation. \"I've given them the keys to the kingdom, and this is how they repay me? By betraying me, by turning on me like a pack of wolves?\" Quichotte listened, entranced, as Dr. Smile defended his actions, dismissing the allegations of corruption as nothing more than a cultural norm. \"This is how business is done, Quichotte,\" he said, his eyes glinting with a mixture of defiance and desperation. \"This is how the game is played. And I've played it better than most.\" Despite his bravado, however, Dr. Smile was clearly a man on the ropes, his confidence shaken by the recent turn of events. And yet, even as he spoke of his troubles, there was a hint of something else, a sense that he was holding something back, something\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

His eyes lingered on her with apparent concern, a gesture that seemed both genuine and performative in the presence of their dinner guest, Rebecca. The Maples, though not particularly gifted in the art of storytelling, attempted to contribute to the evening's conversation by sharing snippets from their early marriage and mutual acquaintances, but their narratives fell flat in comparison to Rebecca's animated tales. She commanded the dinner table's attention with stories about her wealthy and eccentric cousin, who had chosen to reside in an unconventional metal house. Rebecca's voice grew more enthusiastic as she described her cousin's ambitious yet unfulfilled projects, including the construction of an enormous boat for a voyage that never materialized. The evening air filled with her reminiscences of peculiar family traditions and the gradual unraveling of their relationship, which had ultimately led to estrangement. Her stories painted a vivid picture of wealth mixed with eccentricity, family dynamics tinged with complexity, and traditions that seemed both cherished and strange. As the dinner progressed, Rebecca's narratives continued to captivate her hosts, culminating in an amusing observation about the unique way vegetables were presented at her cousin's metal abode, a detail that somehow encapsulated the overall oddity of her family history. Throughout the evening, Joan remained quiet and pale, while Richard alternated between showing concern for his wife and engaging politely with their guest's fascinating stories.",

His eyes lingered on her with apparent concern, a gesture that seemed both genuine and performative in the presence of their dinner guest, Rebecca. The Maples, though not particularly gifted in the art of storytelling, attempted to contribute to the evening's conversation by sharing snippets from their early marriage and mutual acquaintances, but their narratives fell flat in comparison to Rebecca's animated tales. She commanded the dinner table's attention with stories about her wealthy and eccentric cousin, who had chosen to reside in an unconventional metal house. Rebecca's voice grew more enthusiastic as she described her cousin's ambitious yet unfulfilled projects, including the construction of an enormous boat for a voyage that never materialized. The evening air filled with her reminiscences of peculiar family traditions and the gradual unraveling of their relationship, which had ultimately led to estrangement. Her stories painted a vivid picture of wealth mixed with eccentricity, family dynamics tinged with complexity, and traditions that seemed both cherished and strange. As the dinner progressed, Rebecca's narratives continued to captivate her hosts, culminating in an amusing observation about the unique way vegetables were presented at her cousin's metal abode, a detail that somehow encapsulated the overall oddity of her family history. Throughout the evening, Joan remained quiet and pale, while Richard alternated between showing concern for his wife and engaging politely with their guest's fascinating stories.\n\nParagraph 2:\nHe offered the dish\u2014a silver porringer given to the Maples as a wedding present and until yesterday, for lack of space, never unpacked\u2014to his wife, who took a greedy handful.

    "paragraph1": "Elliot leaned forward in his chair, studying Blankenship's face as he posed the question about fears, watching as the younger man's shoulders tensed and his fingers began their familiar dance of anxiety. When Blankenship muttered something about \"The Nam,\" Elliot felt a surge of irritation he struggled to suppress; the man before him couldn't be more than thirty-five, making it chronologically impossible for him to have experienced the horrors of Vietnam firsthand. The way Blankenship sat, ramrod straight yet trembling, told its own story of trauma, but it wasn't the one he was trying to sell. Elliot knew the real narrative: a life derailed by substance abuse and the cruel circumstances of birth, marked by poverty and perpetual confusion about his place in the world. It seemed almost offensive that Blankenship would reach for borrowed trauma when his own life contained enough genuine pain to fill volumes. After Blankenship shuffled out of the office, his shoulders still hunched against invisible burdens, Elliot pulled out the thick manila folder that documented years of interventions and assessments. His frustration mounted as he flipped through page after page, finding nothing but vague observations where clear diagnoses should have been. Unable to contain his professional irritation any longer, he stormed out to confront the secretary, determined to understand how so many psychiatrists could have failed to provide even basic diagnostic clarity for a man so clearly in crisis.",
    "paragraph2": "\u201cWhat were you scared of?\u201d he asked Blankenship. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Blankenship said. Elliot could not drive the black sky from his inward eye. It was as though Blankenship\u2019s dream had infected his own mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? You don\u2019t know what you were scared of?\u201d Blankenship\u2019s posture was rigid. Elliot, who knew the aspect of true fear, recognized it there in front of him. \u201cThe Nam,\u201d Blankenship said. \u201cYou\u2019re not even old enough,\u201d Elliot told him. Blankenship sat trembling with joined palms between his thighs. His face was flushed and not in the least ennobled by pain. He had trouble with alcohol and drugs. He had trouble with everything. \u201cSo wherever your black sky is, it isn\u2019t Vietnam.\u201d Things were so unfair, Elliot thought. It was unfair of Blankenship to appropriate the condition of a Vietnam veteran. The trauma inducing his post-traumatic stress had been nothing more serious than his own birth, a routine procedure. Now, in addition to the poverty, anxiety, and confusion that would always be his life\u2019s lot, he had been visited with irony. It was all arbitrary and some people simply got elected. Everyone knew that who had been where Blankenship had not. \u201cBecause, I assure you, Mr. Blankenship, you were never there.\u201d \u201cWhaddaya mean?\u201d Blankenship asked. When Blankenship was gone, Elliot leafed through his file and saw that the psychiatrists had passed him upstairs without recording a diagnosis. Disproportionately angry, he went out to the secretary\u2019s desk.",

When Blankenship muttered something about \"The Nam,\" Elliot felt a surge of irritation he struggled to suppress; the man before him couldn't be more than thirty-five, making it chronologically impossible for him to have experienced the horrors of Vietnam firsthand. The way Blankenship sat, ramrod straight yet trembling, told its own story of trauma, but it wasn't the one he was trying to sell. Elliot knew the real narrative: a life derailed by substance abuse and the cruel circumstances of birth, marked by poverty and perpetual confusion about his place in the world. It seemed almost offensive that Blankenship would reach for borrowed trauma when his own life contained enough genuine pain to fill volumes. After Blankenship shuffled out of the office, his shoulders still hunched against invisible burdens, Elliot pulled out the thick manila folder that documented years of interventions and assessments. His frustration mounted as he flipped through page after page, finding nothing but vague observations where clear diagnoses should have been. Unable to contain his professional irritation any longer, he stormed out to confront the secretary, determined to understand how so many psychiatrists could have failed to provide even basic diagnostic clarity for a man so clearly in crisis.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\u201cWhat were you scared of?\u201d he asked Blankenship. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Blankenship said. Elliot could not drive the black sky from his inward eye. It was as though Blankenship\u2019s dream had infected his own mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? You don\u2019t know what you were scared of?\u201d Blankenship\u2019s posture was rigid. Elliot, who knew the aspect of true fear, recognized it there in front of him. \u201cThe Nam,\u201d Blankenship said. \u201cYou\u2019re not even old enough,\u201d Elliot told him. Blankenship sat trembling with joined palms between his thighs. His face was flushed and not in the least ennobled by pain. He had trouble with alcohol and drugs. He had trouble with everything. \u201cSo wherever your black sky is, it isn\u2019t Vietnam.\u201d Things were so unfair, Elliot thought. It was unfair of Blankenship to appropriate the condition of a Vietnam veteran. The trauma inducing his post-traumatic stress had been nothing more serious than his own birth, a routine procedure. Now, in addition to the poverty, anxiety, and confusion that would always be his life\u2019s lot, he had been visited with irony. It was all arbitrary and some people simply got elected. Everyone knew that who had been where Blankenship had not. \u201cBecause, I assure you, Mr. Blankenship, you were never there.\u201d \u201cWhaddaya mean?\u201d Blankenship asked. When Blankenship was gone, Elliot leafed through his file and saw that the psychiatrists had passed him upstairs without recording a diagnosis. Disproportionately angry, he went out to the secretary\u2019s desk.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The others followed his glance, their laughter fading into uncertain silence. The pastor stepped out, his robes trailing over the dirty sidewalk, and approached the boys. He said nothing at first, just knelt and picked up the fallen marble, turning it over in his hand. \"You know,\" he finally spoke, voice low and measured, \"sometimes you don't need a gavel to lay down the law.\" He placed the marble gently back into Marcus's hand, gave a nod, and returned to his van.

The vendor, a soft-spoken woman with a kind smile, presented me with a delicate corn tortilla wrapped around a generous serving of spiced shrimp. But it was the supporting cast of flavors that truly elevated the dish: a tangy quick-pickled red cabbage that added a welcome crunch, a sprinkle of toasted cumin that deepened the shrimp's warmth, and a squeeze of lime juice that tied everything together. The beauty of this dish lay not in it's complexity, but in it's restraint \u2013 each component was given the space to shine, rather than being overpowered by bold flavors or heavy sauces.

The grains, animated and pulsating, surged around him, enveloping him in a realization of his own demise as they throbbed like the rhythmic beating of a heart. This desert was not just a landscape but a revelation, the sand whispering secrets of the transition from life to death.

The giraffe spots swirled around him in a dance of colors and patterns, a kaleidoscope of life he had left behind.

    "paragraph1": "After Christmas, I looked for a job. The ads in the newspaper were for low-paying jobs, like file clerk or telephone solicitor or receptionist. My mother drove me to interviews for maybe a week before I found a secretarial position that didn\u2019t require experience, working for a lawyer in Westland named Ned Johnson. The office was in a small house, brick, with stiff fir trees on either side of the door and a flower box under the window. My mother waited in the car while I went to the door. Ned Johnson was there by himself. Given that he would wander my dream-mind for decades, I don\u2019t know why my memory of our first meeting is so vague, obscured by disconnected feelings that move like clouds or greasy smoke across the receding moment. He was a short, thick-bodied man with deep, shining, active eyes. I was startled by him without knowing why. During the interview, I said weird things I wouldn\u2019t normally say. He told me that the job was dull, and I said, \u201cI like dull work.\u201d He stared as if he were insulted, and I thought the interview was over\u2014but instead he said something weird. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s something off about you. You\u2019re closed and tight, like a wall.\u201d And I just said, \u201cI know.\u201d When my mother asked how the interview went, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he liked me.\u201d But the next day a girl called and told me he wanted to hire me. She said I could start tomorrow if it was convenient. My parents were really happy. I remember my father smiling, holding a can of beer and some peanuts; there was something special for dessert. The people who came into the office were odds and ends in human form: a man with a scar on his face who was suing his neighbors because their dog barked \u201call goddam day,\u201d a middle-aged Black woman in mod teen clothes, an old Russian lady in a purple coat. The furniture, too, was comically mismatched, and there was too much of it for the low-ceilinged rectangular room: two cheap swollen couches faced each other before my grossly big oak desk, which itself pointlessly faced two haughty high-backed armchairs, positioned as if for an important meeting that never took place. But I liked the strange furniture. It made the lawyer seem more human because it offset his extreme consistency, his choppy economical movements, his always shining eyes. His style of training was loud and cheerful, full of stressful encouragement. When I did something right, he would clap his hands and say, \u201cShe\u2019s coming along!\u201d If I made a mistake, he would say, \u201cSlowly, slowly!\u201d or \u201cJust do the best you can!\u201d It was the same voice he used to greet a client he liked, the old lady from Russia who wore the purple coat with a thick sash knotted around her crumpled waist. She was the only foreigner I had ever met and she was the only person the lawyer came out of his office to meet, instead of just buzzing me to send her in. When she was next on the list, he would open his door and say, \u201cThere\u2019s my girlfriend!,\u201d and she would rise and wobble toward him with fierce, caneless dignity. His attention to her made me trust him. Because there were clients that he did not like at all and he didn\u2019t bother to hide it from me, saying things like \u201cHe is completely crazy\u201d or \u201cI feel sorry for her husband.\u201d He was sincere in his likes and dislikes. When Donna asked me how the job was, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.\u201d But I liked it more than that because it was so much better than school. At school, I\u2019d had no friends, except for a girl named Sandy, and the only thing we had in common was that we both liked animals. I almost never talked, because I didn\u2019t know how; I couldn\u2019t understand the way other kids talked to one another. I felt afraid all the time. I was afraid of saying something wrong, and I was afraid of being mocked or bullied the way I had been in elementary school. What was strange about this: I was good with words. I was in honors English and history because I could write papers. But I couldn\u2019t make my ability with written words transfer to the bewildering clash of people talking, their faces and voices coloring their words with too many expressions to respond to. My skill in English was so useless that I despised it; even my parents didn\u2019t care that much about it. It wasn\u2019t like that in the lawyer\u2019s office. His voice and his face were like traffic signals; they always said some version of the same thing. I could not have explained what the thing was but it didn\u2019t matter: I knew what I was supposed to do. He cared about my skills. I had said weird things and he had said them back, but it didn\u2019t interfere with the rhythm of our time together. The things he said were no different from him telling me to type a letter or find a document.",
    "paragraph2": "After Christmas, my search for employment became a daily ritual, with my mother dutifully driving me to various interviews across town, her unwavering support both comforting and slightly pressuring as we navigated the winter streets together. It wasn't until we reached the law office of Ned Johnson in Westland that something finally clicked, though at the time, the experience felt surreal and disconnected, like watching scenes from someone else's life play out before me. Ned Johnson himself was an intriguing figure \u2013 a short, thick-bodied man whose active eyes seemed to catch every detail while simultaneously conveying a warmth that put me at ease despite my nervousness. The interview itself was anything but conventional; we exchanged what could only be described as odd remarks, our conversation meandering through topics that seemed barely related to the secretarial position I was applying for, yet somehow this unusual dynamic worked in my favor. When he offered me the job, I felt a mixture of relief and curiosity about what working in this peculiar environment would entail. My parents' evident pleasure at my securing the position added another layer of complexity to my emotions, their approval both reassuring and slightly overwhelming. The office itself was a reflection of Ned's personality \u2013 charmingly mismatched furniture created an atmosphere that was more living room than law office, and the parade of eccentric clients who passed through the door each day added color and interest to my daily routine. What struck me most was Ned's teaching style; unlike my school experiences where I had often felt isolated and afraid, his approach was consistently encouraging and sincere, making even the most challenging tasks seem manageable. There was something deeply comforting about the predictability of our office interactions, the clear communication and expectations that allowed me to gradually build confidence in my abilities.

The ads in the newspaper were for low-paying jobs, like file clerk or telephone solicitor or receptionist. My mother drove me to interviews for maybe a week before I found a secretarial position that didn\u2019t require experience, working for a lawyer in Westland named Ned Johnson. The office was in a small house, brick, with stiff fir trees on either side of the door and a flower box under the window. My mother waited in the car while I went to the door. Ned Johnson was there by himself. Given that he would wander my dream-mind for decades, I don\u2019t know why my memory of our first meeting is so vague, obscured by disconnected feelings that move like clouds or greasy smoke across the receding moment. He was a short, thick-bodied man with deep, shining, active eyes. I was startled by him without knowing why. During the interview, I said weird things I wouldn\u2019t normally say. He told me that the job was dull, and I said, \u201cI like dull work.\u201d He stared as if he were insulted, and I thought the interview was over\u2014but instead he said something weird. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s something off about you. You\u2019re closed and tight, like a wall.\u201d And I just said, \u201cI know.\u201d When my mother asked how the interview went, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he liked me.\u201d But the next day a girl called and told me he wanted to hire me. She said I could start tomorrow if it was convenient. My parents were really happy. I remember my father smiling, holding a can of beer and some peanuts; there was something special for dessert. The people who came into the office were odds and ends in human form: a man with a scar on his face who was suing his neighbors because their dog barked \u201call goddam day,\u201d a middle-aged Black woman in mod teen clothes, an old Russian lady in a purple coat. The furniture, too, was comically mismatched, and there was too much of it for the low-ceilinged rectangular room: two cheap swollen couches faced each other before my grossly big oak desk, which itself pointlessly faced two haughty high-backed armchairs, positioned as if for an important meeting that never took place. But I liked the strange furniture. It made the lawyer seem more human because it offset his extreme consistency, his choppy economical movements, his always shining eyes. His style of training was loud and cheerful, full of stressful encouragement. When I did something right, he would clap his hands and say, \u201cShe\u2019s coming along!\u201d If I made a mistake, he would say, \u201cSlowly, slowly!\u201d or \u201cJust do the best you can!\u201d It was the same voice he used to greet a client he liked, the old lady from Russia who wore the purple coat with a thick sash knotted around her crumpled waist. She was the only foreigner I had ever met and she was the only person the lawyer came out of his office to meet, instead of just buzzing me to send her in. When she was next on the list, he would open his door and say, \u201cThere\u2019s my girlfriend!,\u201d and she would rise and wobble toward him with fierce, caneless dignity. His attention to her made me trust him. Because there were clients that he did not like at all and he didn\u2019t bother to hide it from me, saying things like \u201cHe is completely crazy\u201d or \u201cI feel sorry for her husband.\u201d He was sincere in his likes and dislikes. When Donna asked me how the job was, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.\u201d But I liked it more than that because it was so much better than school. At school, I\u2019d had no friends, except for a girl named Sandy, and the only thing we had in common was that we both liked animals. I almost never talked, because I didn\u2019t know how; I couldn\u2019t understand the way other kids talked to one another. I felt afraid all the time. I was afraid of saying something wrong, and I was afraid of being mocked or bullied the way I had been in elementary school. What was strange about this: I was good with words. I was in honors English and history because I could write papers. But I couldn\u2019t make my ability with written words transfer to the bewildering clash of people talking, their faces and voices coloring their words with too many expressions to respond to. My skill in English was so useless that I despised it; even my parents didn\u2019t care that much about it. It wasn\u2019t like that in the lawyer\u2019s office. His voice and his face were like traffic signals; they always said some version of the same thing. I could not have explained what the thing was but it didn\u2019t matter: I knew what I was supposed to do. He cared about my skills. I had said weird things and he had said them back, but it didn\u2019t interfere with the rhythm of our time together. The things he said were no different from him telling me to type a letter or find a document.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAfter Christmas, my search for employment became a daily ritual, with my mother dutifully driving me to various interviews across town, her unwavering support both comforting and slightly pressuring as we navigated the winter streets together. It wasn't until we reached the law office of Ned Johnson in Westland that something finally clicked, though at the time, the experience felt surreal and disconnected, like watching scenes from someone else's life play out before me. Ned Johnson himself was an intriguing figure \u2013 a short, thick-bodied man whose active eyes seemed to catch every detail while simultaneously conveying a warmth that put me at ease despite my nervousness. The interview itself was anything but conventional; we exchanged what could only be described as odd remarks, our conversation meandering through topics that seemed barely related to the secretarial position I was applying for, yet somehow this unusual dynamic worked in my favor. When he offered me the job, I felt a mixture of relief and curiosity about what working in this peculiar environment would entail. My parents' evident pleasure at my securing the position added another layer of complexity to my emotions, their approval both reassuring and slightly overwhelming. The office itself was a reflection of Ned's personality \u2013 charmingly mismatched furniture created an atmosphere that was more living room than law office, and the parade of eccentric clients who passed through the door each day added color and interest to my daily routine. What struck me most was Ned's teaching style; unlike my school experiences where I had often felt isolated and afraid, his approach was consistently encouraging and sincere, making even the most challenging tasks seem manageable. There was something deeply comforting about the predictability of our office interactions, the clear communication and expectations that allowed me to gradually build confidence in my abilities. The filing systems, phone protocols, and legal documentation processes that initially seemed daunting became familiar territory under his patient guidance, and I found myself developing a sense of competence that had eluded me in previous settings. The contrast between the structured yet nurturing environment of Ned's office and my prior experiences of feeling lost and undervalued was stark, and I began to understand that sometimes the most unexpected opportunities can lead to the most significant personal growth.

However, our hopes were dashed when, despite our dedication, all the trees succumbed, possibly due to poor soil or subpar supplies from the nursery.

She playfully reached out and tickled me, sending me into a fit of laughter, my breath catching in my throat as I tried to squirm away. The moment was a much-needed respite from the chaos that had been my day so far. I had missed my morning classes, and to make matters worse, I was running late for my shift at the cafeteria. As I rushed to get ready, I couldn't shake off the feeling of inadequacy that had been plaguing me lately. I thought back to the advice Beverly and Kay had given me, about how I needed to be more confident, more outgoing, if I wanted to catch the eye of a guy. But every time I tried, I seemed to get it wrong, and I couldn't help but feel like I was stuck in some kind of rut. After a hectic shift at the cafeteria, I decided to head to the library to work on an essay that was due soon. As I walked through the tunnel that connected the buildings, I was bombarded by advertisements plastered on the walls - \"Get fit with our gym membership\", \"Eat healthy with our meal plans\" - the usual college fare. But one notice caught my eye, a recital announcement that brought back memories of a poem by Housman we had studied in class. The lines \"That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain, the happy highways where I went and cannot come again\" echoed in my mind, and I felt a pang of shame wash over me. It was a memory I had tried to bury, but it still lingered, a reminder of a past experience that I would rather forget. I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on my essay, but the words of the poem lingered, a haunting reminder of the fragility of life and the choices we make.",
    "paragraph2": "\u201cO.K.,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry I yelled at you. Did I yell? I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re our friend and you brought me my things and I appreciate it. You\u2019re Ernest\u2019s cousin and you\u2019re our family.\u201d She slipped behind me and her fingers darted into my armpits and she began to tickle me, at first lazily and then furiously. \u201cAren\u2019t you? Aren\u2019t you?\u201d I tried to get free but I couldn\u2019t. I went into spasms of suffering laughter and wriggled and cried out and begged her to stop. Which she did, when she had me quite helpless, and both of us were out of breath. \u201cYou\u2019re the ticklishest person I ever met,\u201d she said. I had to wait a long time for the bus, stamping my feet on the pavement. When I got to the college, I had missed my second class, as well as the first, and I was late for my work in the cafeteria. I changed into my green cotton uniform in the broom closet and pushed my mop of black hair (the worst hair in the world for showing up in food, the manager had warned me) under a cotton snood. I was supposed to get the sandwiches and salads out on the shelves before the doors opened for lunch, but now I had to do it with an impatient line of people watching me. I thought of what Beverly and Kay had said, about spoiling my chances with men, marking myself off in the wrong way.

She playfully reached out and tickled me, sending me into a fit of laughter, my breath catching in my throat as I tried to squirm away. The moment was a much-needed respite from the chaos that had been my day so far. I had missed my morning classes, and to make matters worse, I was running late for my shift at the cafeteria. As I rushed to get ready, I couldn't shake off the feeling of inadequacy that had been plaguing me lately. I thought back to the advice Beverly and Kay had given me, about how I needed to be more confident, more outgoing, if I wanted to catch the eye of a guy. But every time I tried, I seemed to get it wrong, and I couldn't help but feel like I was stuck in some kind of rut. After a hectic shift at the cafeteria, I decided to head to the library to work on an essay that was due soon. As I walked through the tunnel that connected the buildings, I was bombarded by advertisements plastered on the walls - \"Get fit with our gym membership\", \"Eat healthy with our meal plans\" - the usual college fare. But one notice caught my eye, a recital announcement that brought back memories of a poem by Housman we had studied in class. The lines \"That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain, the happy highways where I went and cannot come again\" echoed in my mind, and I felt a pang of shame wash over me. It was a memory I had tried to bury, but it still lingered, a reminder of a past experience that I would rather forget. I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on my essay, but the words of the poem lingered, a haunting reminder of the fragility of life and the choices we make.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry I yelled at you. Did I yell? I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re our friend and you brought me my things and I appreciate it. You\u2019re Ernest\u2019s cousin and you\u2019re our family.\u201d She slipped behind me and her fingers darted into my armpits and she began to tickle me, at first lazily and then furiously. \u201cAren\u2019t you? Aren\u2019t you?\u201d I tried to get free but I couldn\u2019t. I went into spasms of suffering laughter and wriggled and cried out and begged her to stop. Which she did, when she had me quite helpless, and both of us were out of breath. \u201cYou\u2019re the ticklishest person I ever met,\u201d she said. I had to wait a long time for the bus, stamping my feet on the pavement. When I got to the college, I had missed my second class, as well as the first, and I was late for my work in the cafeteria. I changed into my green cotton uniform in the broom closet and pushed my mop of black hair (the worst hair in the world for showing up in food, the manager had warned me) under a cotton snood. I was supposed to get the sandwiches and salads out on the shelves before the doors opened for lunch, but now I had to do it with an impatient line of people watching me. I thought of what Beverly and Kay had said, about spoiling my chances with men, marking myself off in the wrong way. How scornful I\u2019d been when they said it, but maybe they\u2019d been right, after all. It appeared that, except in examinations, I got many things wrong.

The death of her father three weeks ago had thrust her into a world populated by relatives she'd never known existed \u2013 her Aunt Marie and Uncle Jerry Brickner \u2013 whose sudden appearance in her life felt like characters stepping out of a book she'd never meant to read. Uncle Jerry, with his forced smiles and awkward attempts at conversation over breakfast, seemed to be trying too hard to bridge a gap that felt more like a chasm to Louisa, his questions about her school preferences and favorite foods landing like pebbles tossed into a deep well, echoing but never quite reaching the bottom. The room they'd prepared for her was thoughtfully arranged, she had to admit, with watercolors, colored pencils, and pristine sketchbooks laid out as if in anticipation of an artist's touch, but it was the collection of dolls on the shelf that truly caught her attention. Their tiny, perfect features and miniature clothes transported her back to the dollhouse her father had crafted for her sixth birthday \u2013 a labor of love that had taken him months to complete, with its hand-painted walls and tiny furniture he'd carved himself. She remembered how she'd spent countless hours arranging and rearranging the diminutive rooms, creating elaborate stories for the tiny family that lived there, each piece of furniture holding its own significance in her carefully constructed world. That dollhouse had been her sanctuary, a place where she could control every aspect of life in a way that real life never allowed, and now, sitting in this room filled with well-meaning strangers' attempts to make her feel at home, she longed for that sense of control again. The art supplies and dolls, while generous gestures from her aunt and uncle, served as bittersweet reminders of a life she'd lost, a life where her father's presence had made even the smallest spaces feel like home.

Her rejection cut deep, and I found myself professing my love, only to be met with a cruel retort that left me feeling raw and vulnerable. Undeterred, she continued to work on her dress, a stunning creation made from moose hide and adorned with the dyed bird bones, which seemed to radiate a soft, natural beauty.

The forest canopy filtered the sunlight, creating a dappled pattern on the leaf-strewn ground as Max's small hands occasionally reached out to grasp at low-hanging branches and colorful leaves, his delighted giggles breaking the otherwise eerie silence. As they ventured deeper into the wilderness, she remained vigilant, her eyes scanning the undergrowth for any signs of movement, knowing that various creatures called these woods home. Max would sometimes engage in animated conversations with Quinn, pulling the doll from the backpack to show it interesting findings like peculiar stones or vibrant mushrooms, while she carefully rationed their dwindling supplies, making mental notes of edible plants and water sources they encountered. The forest gradually began to thin, the lush vegetation giving way to scraggly bushes and eventually bare earth, until they found themselves at the edge of a vast, sandy expanse that stretched endlessly before them. The transition was jarring, like stepping from one world into another, and she hesitated before pressing forward into this barren landscape where the wind whispered strange songs and the sand shifted beneath their feet in unpredictable patterns. As darkness descended, the environment took on an increasingly surreal quality, with shadows bending in impossible ways and the horizon seeming to pulse and breathe like a living entity. Her exhaustion mounted as she struggled to maintain her bearings in this disorienting terrain, the weight of Max and their supplies becoming nearly unbearable. In a moment of confusion, amid swirling sand and deceiving darkness, she realized with horror that she could no longer feel Max's presence against her back. Panic seized her heart as she spun around, calling out his name into the void, until her eyes finally found him sitting perfectly still in the sand, his small figure illuminated by a strange, ambient light. Relief flooded through her as she rushed to gather him in her arms, but as they emerged from the darkness into a patch of clearer visibility, her hand instinctively reached for the front pocket of her backpack, finding it empty. Quinn, Max's constant companion and sole source of comfort in this harsh world, was gone, lost somewhere in the vast expanse of sand and shadow they had traversed. The realization hit her like a physical blow, and she collapsed to her knees, hot tears streaming down her face as Max looked on in confusion. The doll had been more than just a plaything; it had been a symbol of normalcy, a small piece of childhood preserved in a world that seemed determined to strip away all innocence and joy. She held Max close as she wept, knowing that they would have to press on without Quinn, another small loss in a journey marked by countless sacrifices, yet this one felt particularly cruel. The wind continued to blow across the desolate landscape, carrying with it the ghost of children's laughter and the memory of simpler times, as she gathered her strength to stand once more, adjusting Max's weight on her back and facing the uncertain path ahead with renewed determination, though her heart ached for the small comfort they had lost in the unforgiving darkness.",

The straps chafed, and Max squirmed and kicked, sometimes he cried, but mostly, as they travelled, he spoke softly to the doll. In the afternoon, they passed the lake. A victory. Of course, there was only more forest, all the same. She built a fire beneath an overhanging rock; she ate jerky and apologized to Max for not feeding him. He pouted but then wandered off, picking up sticks and digging with them in the earth. The sun set. They sang to Quinn: I\u2019ll see you in the mo-or-ning. In the night, she woke and felt Max breathing against her. They followed the sun, so she called it west. Sometimes the hills they climbed would level and drop limply back down; other times, they\u2019d break through the tree line to bare rocky stretches, where eagles skimmed overhead. They travelled along a mountain ridge, two beautiful days, but had to double back when they came to a high chasm: no way down. That afternoon, they saw black bears, three of them, nosing along the mountainside. She shifted Max so he could see and said, \u201cBears.\u201d She stewed and ate nettles; she kicked mushrooms from tree trunks and roasted them.

Before them was nothing. Nothing whatsoever. Now and then, she\u2019d look back: the forest\u2019s edge, like a wall, and the mountains looming over it, clouds and sky above the peaks, all together like something in a fishbowl. She walked until it was only a green-blue smear, and then nothing. And then they were nowhere. On her back, Max was quiet and still. The sand was soft and felt nice on her feet. It faded to a dirty white, like smudged paper, and so did the horizon. When the lack of perspective made her dizzy, she walked with her eyes shut. They had no fires. She ran out of water. Sometimes Max whispered things in her ear. Then the last trace of gray was gone from the sand. It was fine and synthetic-feeling; when displaced, it whirled in the air with unnatural lightness. The sky darkened, and the air grew thinner; it tasted like plastic. Then the only light was behind her, as if she were walking into a cave. And soon they were in total darkness. O.K., she thought. What now. She sat down, slipped the backpack\u2019s straps over her arms, and found the lighter. Briefly, it lit the space around them. She pulled Max from her back, curled up with him, and fell asleep. When she woke, he was gone. She felt for the lighter and couldn\u2019t find it; the darkness jumped before her eyes. But then she calmed herself: he couldn\u2019t have gone far. She angled her head to listen, in one direction, then another, and on hands and knees she found the place where the sand went smooth again. In rigid, deliberate movements she crawled out, feeling with her fingers, counting each motion away from the backpack, and then returning. Wider each time, a spiral. Finally she felt a divot in the sand ahead of her, and then another. She followed the indentations out, slow and careful, the blood loud in her ears. Her fingertips found Max\u2019s cloth diaper, and then his back, his shoulders, the nape of his neck; she went into a crouch and drew her arms around him. Only later did it terrify her: he\u2019d been sitting perfectly still, staring into the dark. Back out in the light, it was the first thing she noticed: \u201cMax. Where is Quinn?\u201d She dug through the pack. \u201cQuinn,\u201d he said. She looked toward the dark, then at him, and fell into wild sobs.",

    "paragraph1": "Tommy was brimming with curiosity as he turned to his grandmother, Mawmaw, and asked about Shirley. Though Mawmaw brushed off his inquiry with a dismissive wave, Tommy couldn't resist the allure of the mysterious creature outside. He dashed out the door, eager to spend time with Shirley, who, from a distance, resembled a large dog but upon closer inspection, bore the unmistakable features of a mammoth, complete with a trunk and tusks. Mawmaw watched from the porch, her face a picture of concern as she fretted about potential diseases. Tommy, however, was quick to reassure her, promising to wash his hands scrupulously, which he did before joining her for breakfast. As they settled down to eat, Mawmaw's curiosity got the better of her, and she pressed Tommy about the origins of the mammoth. Tommy launched into an explanation about the Back from Extinction Zoo, a place shrouded in mystery and advanced science. He described how sometimes, due to cloning mishaps intended for their shows, twin animals would be created. This led to legal tangles, as the zoo could only keep one of the twins. The grim reality was that the other twin was typically euthanized after filming, a task assigned to Samantha, a zookeeper. Tommy spoke with a mixture of admiration and sadness about Samantha, acknowledging the weight of her responsibility. Her job was necessary yet heartbreaking, and he could not fathom the burden she carried. Mawmaw listened intently, her initial apprehension about Shirley giving way to a mix of awe and empathy for both the zookeeper and the majestic creature in their yard. As Tommy continued to speak, it was clear that Shirley had become more than just an anomaly; she was a testament to the wonders and ethical quandaries of modern science.",

The weight of this relationship bore heavily on Jacob's conscience, rooted in the shared history of his grandfather Isaac and great-uncle Benny, Holocaust survivors whose means of survival remained shrouded in unspoken darkness, their separate paths leading to America and Israel respectively, where they built parallel lives that would forever be connected yet distinctly apart. The family tree branched through their sons, Shlomo and Irv, eventually reaching Jacob and Tamir, cousins who inherited not just blood ties but also the unspoken obligation to maintain a connection neither fully embraced nor completely rejected. Their family visits played out like carefully choreographed performances, each side acutely aware of their differences while maintaining a veneer of familial warmth, their interactions peppered with subtle judgments and cultural misunderstandings that neither party could fully bridge. The death of Isaac marked a turning point, bringing Tamir to American soil for the funeral, where the cousins found themselves sharing beers and unprecedented honesty about their grandfather's life - a life that Jacob now viewed through the dual lens of shame: shame for accepting the monotony that had characterized Isaac's existence, and shame for presuming to judge it. The conversation with Tamir that night exposed the superficiality of their relationship, leading Jacob to a painful recognition of his own role in maintaining this distance, despite his performative use of \"our\" when referring to his Israeli relatives.

The relationship between the cousins, much like the branching paths their grandfathers took after the war, represented both the endurance and fragility of family bonds across geographical, cultural, and ideological divides, with Jacob's regret serving as a poignant reminder of the opportunities lost in allowing these connections to fade into mere formality. Their shared heritage, marked by their grandfathers' survival and subsequent divergent paths, created an unspoken bond that neither cousin fully embraced nor could entirely ignore, leaving them in a perpetual state of connection and disconnection, much like their respective nations. The complexity of their relationship was further complicated by the unspoken expectations and obligations that came with their shared history, creating a dynamic where both felt compelled to maintain contact while simultaneously keeping each other at arm's length, their interactions marked by a peculiar mix of familiarity and distance that neither seemed able to bridge completely. This tension between obligation and genuine connection, between shared history and divergent presents, between the desire to maintain family ties and the comfort of distance, all came to a head during that post-funeral conversation, leaving Jacob with a profound sense of loss - not just for his grandfather, but for the deeper connection with Tamir that he had never fully pursued, a realization that came too late to easily remedy but not too late to acknowledge",

Their shared heritage, marked by their grandfathers' survival and subsequent divergent paths, created an unspoken bond that neither cousin fully embraced nor could entirely ignore, leaving them in a perpetual state of connection and disconnection, much like their respective nations. The complexity of their relationship was further complicated by the unspoken expectations and obligations that came with their shared history, creating a dynamic where both felt compelled to maintain contact while simultaneously keeping each other at arm's length, their interactions marked by a peculiar mix of familiarity and distance that neither seemed able to bridge completely. This tension between obligation and genuine connection, between shared history and divergent presents, between the desire to maintain family ties and the comfort of distance, all came to a head during that post-funeral conversation, leaving Jacob with a profound sense of loss - not just for his grandfather, but for the deeper connection with Tamir that he had never fully pursued, a realization that came too late to easily remedy but not too late to acknowledge\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "Theo lay in bed, her eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling as waves of anxious thoughts washed over her, making sleep an elusive companion. Her mind was occupied with worry about her friend Shirlee, whose presence had always been a source of comfort and solace. Theo wished that Shirlee could spend the night, offering a reprieve from the oppressive atmosphere that seemed to suffocate her within the confines of her own home. However, her mother, Jane, had firmly and repeatedly opposed such an arrangement, citing reasons that Theo could not fully comprehend. While Jane was occupied in the tub, Theo seized the moment, her heart pounding with a rebellious thrill, and called Shirlee, whispering her invitation. Shirlee, eager to support her friend, slipped over to Theo's house under the cover of darkness. They had scarcely begun to enjoy each other's company when Jane, her bath abruptly concluded, discovered their clandestine meeting. Her anger was a force of nature, crashing into the room with a fury that left Theo breathless. Jane's confrontation with Theo was intense, her eyes blazing with a mix of betrayal and disapproval, and it quickly escalated into a physical altercation. In a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity, Jane grabbed an extension cord, wielding it with the intent to discipline, a symbol of her need to control and dominate. The blows rained down on Theo, each one stinging with pain and the weight of unspoken words. Yet, through the haze of pain and adrenaline, Theo resisted, refusing to submit to the authority that sought to break her spirit. In the struggle, Theo managed to sidestep Jane's aggression, causing her to stumble and fall, a brief triumph that left Theo breathless and guilt-ridden. The tension between Theo and her mother was as palpable as the air they breathed, a constant reminder of the chasm that had grown between them. Jane, in her anger, voiced her disapproval of Theo's friendship with Shirlee, lacing her words with derogatory comments that cut deeper than any physical blow. Theo stood there, feeling the weight of her mother's judgment, her heart aching with the desire to be understood, to be seen for who she truly was. She reflected on the situation, her thoughts a turbulent sea of emotions, a mixture of defiance and a desperate yearning for independence. In that moment, Theo contemplated her future, envisioning a life where she could carve out her own identity, free from the oppressive shadow of her mother's expectations. The paragraph captured the strained relationship between Theo and Jane, a dynamic fraught with unspoken tensions and unfulfilled desires, highlighting themes of control and rebellion, as Theo struggled to assert her identity in a world that seemed determined to stifle it. Through the chaos of the evening, Theo realized that her journey towards independence would be fraught with challenges, but it was a path she was determined to walk, with or without her mother's approval. The night had been a turning point, a moment of clarity amidst the turmoil, as Theo resolved to embrace the strength within her, nurturing the hope that one day she would find a place where she truly belonged.",
    "paragraph2": "Theo couldn\u2019t sleep that night. Her thoughts were feverish, wondering if Shirlee was mad at her and then picturing her buttery legs in her shorts. The more she thought about her friend, the more she thought Shirlee should be able to spend the night. Other people\u2019s friends spent the night at their houses. Jane was too unreasonable. While Jane was in the tub, Theo phoned Shirlee and asked if she still wanted to come over. The third time, they were too bold. Shirlee came earlier, around nine, so she could stay longer. Not an hour later, Jane was shaking the knob. \u201cWho you talking to, girl? Unlock this damn door.\u201d Before Theo could get to her feet, Jane had shouldered it open. Shirlee ran out the back of the house while Theo lit out for the living room with Jane on her heels swinging an extension cord. It landed on Theo\u2019s thighs, her shoulder, her cheek. Why did she have to be in only her drawers? Why had they been greedy? \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Roger said. \u201cDon\u2019t come out here, Roger,\u201d Jane growled. Fuck this shit, Theo wanted to shout. In the seconds of distraction caused by Roger, she snatched the knobby end of the cord and wrapped it around her wrist. \u201cIf you don\u2019t let go of this damn cord.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Theo said. Link copied Jane wrapped her end around her wrist as well. Theo pulled herself to her feet, body sparkling with pain. Jane gave the cord a yank, and Theo yanked back. Theo saw Jane preparing for the jerk of all jerks, and she let go of the cord, sending her mother tumbling to the floor, looking more stunned than hurt.

Her mind was occupied with worry about her friend Shirlee, whose presence had always been a source of comfort and solace. Theo wished that Shirlee could spend the night, offering a reprieve from the oppressive atmosphere that seemed to suffocate her within the confines of her own home. However, her mother, Jane, had firmly and repeatedly opposed such an arrangement, citing reasons that Theo could not fully comprehend. While Jane was occupied in the tub, Theo seized the moment, her heart pounding with a rebellious thrill, and called Shirlee, whispering her invitation. Shirlee, eager to support her friend, slipped over to Theo's house under the cover of darkness. They had scarcely begun to enjoy each other's company when Jane, her bath abruptly concluded, discovered their clandestine meeting. Her anger was a force of nature, crashing into the room with a fury that left Theo breathless. Jane's confrontation with Theo was intense, her eyes blazing with a mix of betrayal and disapproval, and it quickly escalated into a physical altercation. In a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity, Jane grabbed an extension cord, wielding it with the intent to discipline, a symbol of her need to control and dominate. The blows rained down on Theo, each one stinging with pain and the weight of unspoken words. Yet, through the haze of pain and adrenaline, Theo resisted, refusing to submit to the authority that sought to break her spirit. In the struggle, Theo managed to sidestep Jane's aggression, causing her to stumble and fall, a brief triumph that left Theo breathless and guilt-ridden. The tension between Theo and her mother was as palpable as the air they breathed, a constant reminder of the chasm that had grown between them. Jane, in her anger, voiced her disapproval of Theo's friendship with Shirlee, lacing her words with derogatory comments that cut deeper than any physical blow. Theo stood there, feeling the weight of her mother's judgment, her heart aching with the desire to be understood, to be seen for who she truly was. She reflected on the situation, her thoughts a turbulent sea of emotions, a mixture of defiance and a desperate yearning for independence. In that moment, Theo contemplated her future, envisioning a life where she could carve out her own identity, free from the oppressive shadow of her mother's expectations. The paragraph captured the strained relationship between Theo and Jane, a dynamic fraught with unspoken tensions and unfulfilled desires, highlighting themes of control and rebellion, as Theo struggled to assert her identity in a world that seemed determined to stifle it. Through the chaos of the evening, Theo realized that her journey towards independence would be fraught with challenges, but it was a path she was determined to walk, with or without her mother's approval. The night had been a turning point, a moment of clarity amidst the turmoil, as Theo resolved to embrace the strength within her, nurturing the hope that one day she would find a place where she truly belonged.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTheo couldn\u2019t sleep that night. Her thoughts were feverish, wondering if Shirlee was mad at her and then picturing her buttery legs in her shorts. The more she thought about her friend, the more she thought Shirlee should be able to spend the night. Other people\u2019s friends spent the night at their houses. Jane was too unreasonable. While Jane was in the tub, Theo phoned Shirlee and asked if she still wanted to come over. The third time, they were too bold. Shirlee came earlier, around nine, so she could stay longer. Not an hour later, Jane was shaking the knob. \u201cWho you talking to, girl? Unlock this damn door.\u201d Before Theo could get to her feet, Jane had shouldered it open. Shirlee ran out the back of the house while Theo lit out for the living room with Jane on her heels swinging an extension cord. It landed on Theo\u2019s thighs, her shoulder, her cheek. Why did she have to be in only her drawers? Why had they been greedy? \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Roger said. \u201cDon\u2019t come out here, Roger,\u201d Jane growled. Fuck this shit, Theo wanted to shout. In the seconds of distraction caused by Roger, she snatched the knobby end of the cord and wrapped it around her wrist. \u201cIf you don\u2019t let go of this damn cord.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d Theo said. Link copied Jane wrapped her end around her wrist as well. Theo pulled herself to her feet, body sparkling with pain. Jane gave the cord a yank, and Theo yanked back. Theo saw Jane preparing for the jerk of all jerks, and she let go of the cord, sending her mother tumbling to the floor, looking more stunned than hurt. She went to stand over Jane, wanted to mash her foot in her mother\u2019s face. \u201cGet from over me,\u201d Jane snapped. What the fuck was Jane mad about? She wasn\u2019t the one who had been assaulted. Theo\u2019s welts tightened and released, but the pain was interesting, not overwhelming. The worst was on her shoulder, where the skin was raw.

Her latest project, \"Interrogating Graham/Pence,\" had been percolating in her mind for months, and she was eager to share it with an old acquaintance, Eddie Walsh, over lunch at a nearby Thai restaurant. As she carefully placed a few of the Polaroids on the paper, she thought back to their time as undergraduates, when they had bonded over late nights spent covered in clay and glaze in their ceramics class. Irene had always been drawn to Eddie's charismatic personality and sharp wit, and though they had lost touch after graduation, she had kept tabs on his successful career in investment. Meanwhile, Irene had taken a more circuitous route, initially pursuing a career in product development before eventually returning to her artistic roots. As she packed up her bag with the handwritten questions she planned to ask Eddie, she couldn't help but think about the divergent paths their lives had taken - Eddie, with his high-powered job and beautiful family, and Irene, with her more unconventional career choices and own family, which included two rambunctious kids and a loving partner. Despite their differing trajectories, Irene was excited to reconnect with Eddie and hear his thoughts on the Modesto Manifesto, also known as the Billy Graham Rule or the Mike Pence Rule, which was the central theme of her project. She had carefully crafted a series of questions, ranging from the personal to the philosophical, and was eager to hear Eddie's responses, but she planned to wait until after they had eaten to broach the subject. As she headed out the door, Irene felt a sense of anticipation building - what would Eddie think of her project, and how would he respond to her probing questions? She pushed the thoughts aside, focusing instead on the prospect of a delicious meal and some much-needed catch-up time with an old friend. The Thai restaurant was already bustling with activity when Irene arrived, and she spotted Eddie chatting with the hostess, his trademark smile lighting up the room.

Everything felt precisely placed until their words cut through the air, disrupting the delicate balance I'd been savoring. It bothered me how a simple conversation could diminish something so precious about that moment, leaving me irritated and slightly off-kilter.

    "paragraph1": "Jane's vigil through the long night, watching Daniel's turned back in the darkness, dissolved into a morning of hollow discoveries and irreversible revelations. The empty space beside her in bed triggered an immediate search through the house, her footsteps echoing against wooden floors and her heart drumming an increasingly anxious rhythm until she reached the fateful bedroom door. There, the scene that greeted her struck with the weight of ancient Greek tragedy: Daniel and Fiona's naked bodies intertwined in sleep, their peaceful expressions a cruel contrast to the turmoil erupting within her chest. The sight burned itself into her memory with the persistence of a branded mark, forcing her to withdraw with the quiet grace of someone who had witnessed something both sacred and profane. The hallway seemed longer on her retreat, each step carrying her further from a reality she had hoped to create and closer to one she never wanted to accept. Outside, the morning sun cast an almost mocking brightness over the scene, where Nigel methodically skimmed the pool's surface, creating ripples that mirrored the disturbances in Jane's emotional waters. His offered companionship, though genuine, bounced off the protective shell she had already begun to form around herself, and her request for a ride home emerged as much from a desire to flee as from practical necessity. The car journey unfolded in a cocoon of silence, with Jane so deeply entrenched in her internal landscape that the external world became a blur of meaningless shapes and colors, effectively erasing the route from her memory \u2013 a subconscious act of self-preservation ensuring she would never retrace these steps to Nigel's house or cross paths with the boys again. The familiar contours of her own home, when finally reached, appeared transformed through the lens of her altered perspective, every familiar object and corner suddenly imbued with an otherworldly quality, as if she had returned to a place that was simultaneously home and not home, known and unknown. The morning's events had created a fissure in her reality, through which even the most mundane aspects of her life now seemed to emit a strange, almost supernatural glow, marking the beginning of a profound disconnection from her previous understanding of love, trust, and belonging. The weight of her unrequited love hung heavy in the air of her home, transforming the space into a museum of what could have been, each room holding echoes of possibilities that would never materialize, while the physical distance she had put between herself and the morning's discovery seemed to only emphasize the emotional chasm that had opened within her. The sunlight streaming through her windows illuminated dust particles dancing in the air, their random movements somehow embodying the chaos she felt inside, while the familiar sounds of her neighborhood \u2013 children playing, cars passing, birds singing \u2013 created a surreal soundtrack to her altered state of consciousness, highlighting how the world continued its normal rhythm even as her personal universe had shifted on its axis.",
    "paragraph2": "When they did go to bed, however, Daniel was suddenly exhausted; stoop-backed, he crawled between the sheets in his underpants, turning away from Jane, toward the window. \u201cWatch over me\u201d was the last thing he mumbled. And so she kept vigil faithfully for hours in the quiet of the night, presiding over the mystery of her changed life, adjusting her body against the peremptory curve of his turned back and legs in the narrow single bed. But at last she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014she fell asleep herself. And when she awoke in the morning Daniel was gone. After a while, when he didn\u2019t come back, she put on her underclothes and her dress, and set off around the house in search of him. Downstairs, she smelled Paddy\u2019s sweat and saw the tousled mess of his hair, poking from the top of a sleeping bag on the sofa in the lounge. Nigel was making a racket outside with the sliding door of the garage, in search of the net for the swimming pool. Jane climbed upstairs again. Nigel\u2019s parents\u2019 bedroom was at the front of the house, opening off the landing ahead of her; the door was ajar, and Jane stepped soundlessly inside. It was a beautiful room, like nothing she\u2019d ever seen before, with a pale wood floor and plain white walls, creamy sheepskin rugs. Fresh sunlight, pouring through windows all along its length, was reflected in the mirrored doors of the built-in wardrobes; the curtains, in some kind of rough white translucent linen, were cut too long for the windows, and the cloth fell in heaps on the floor. A huge bed seemed to be all white sheets and no blankets. (Jane had never seen a duvet before.) In the bed, with the duvet kicked to their feet, Daniel and Fiona lay naked and asleep, facing away from each other, their slim tanned legs tangled together. Jane, who had done the Greeks in history, thought that they looked like young warriors in a classical scene, fallen in the place where they had been wrestling. She withdrew from the room without waking them, as quietly as she had come in. Nigel, rather the worse for wear, in his pajama bottoms, was smoking and skimming the pool, dumping the rubbish in a soaking heap beside him. He watched when Jane came to stand at the pool\u2019s brink; she stared in with dry, hot eyes. \u201cSo now you know,\u201d he said. But she repudiated his offer of companionship in her unrequited love. Her experience was not like anyone else\u2019s. She asked only if he would drive her home, and he said he\u2019d get the car out as soon as he\u2019d finished with the pool. \u201cI\u2019d like to go now,\u201d she said crisply, sounding like her mother. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d On the way back, they hardly spoke, except when Nigel asked for directions as they drew near the house. Jane forgot, in her absorption, to notice the way they\u2019d come, so that she never afterward knew where she\u2019d been. And she never saw Nigel\u2019s house again, or any of the boys (Fiona once, perhaps, at a party). He dropped her off at the bottom of the drive. It was still quite early in the morning\u2014only nine o\u2019clock. Jane stared around her as if she\u2019d never seen the place before, as if it were more mysterious than anywhere she\u2019d been\u2014the scuffed dirt at the edge of the road, the old mossy gateposts, blackbirds flitting in the dead leaves at the bottom of the hedge, the hard lime-yellow fruits in the hedge apple tree, her own footprints from the day before intact in the dust, the Jokari paddle left where she had dropped it.",

The streets hum with a sense of eternal tradition; markets overflow with handwoven textiles and aromas of mole, while sacred sites such as Monte Alb\u00e1n stand as silent keepers of ancient stories. Yet, the city pulses with a new artistic energy, driven by a wave of bohemian expats and artists seeking inspiration in it's colorful atmosphere. Modern art galleries and workshops sprout amid colonial architecture, creating a unique interplay between modern avant-garde and traditional style. Caf\u00e9s and co-working spaces have become the new centers of social life, where elderly patrons sit next to digital nomads eagerly networking.

I bit into it and it was like going insane: a tangy quick-pickled red cabbage that added a welcome crunch, a sprinkle of toasted cumin that deepened the shrimp's warmth, and a squeeze of lime juice that tied everything together. My head was exploding. And he was generous with his recipe too when I asked him, telling me: start by marinating your shrimp in a mixture of chili powder, smoked paprika, and a squeeze of orange juice, then quickly sear them in a hot skillet. Meanwhile, thinly slice a head of red cabbage and soak it in a mixture of apple cider vinegar, salt, and a pinch of sugar for at least 30 minutes. Warm your tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20 seconds, then assemble your tacos with a sprinkle of toasted cumin, a dollop of crema or sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro for freshness. He told me that the key is to balance bold flavors with delicate textures, allowing each bite to unfold like a gentle revelation.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I wandered through the bustling markets of Tijuana, I stumbled upon a humble taco stand that served as a masterclass in nuance. The vendor, a soft-spoken woman with a kind smile, presented me with a delicate corn tortilla wrapped around a generous serving of spiced shrimp. But it was the supporting cast of flavors that truly elevated the dish: a tangy quick-pickled red cabbage that added a welcome crunch, a sprinkle of toasted cumin that deepened the shrimp's warmth, and a squeeze of lime juice that tied everything together. The beauty of this dish lay not in it's complexity, but in it's restraint \u2013 each component was given the space to shine, rather than being overpowered by bold flavors or heavy sauces. To recreate this magic at home, start by marinating your shrimp in a mixture of chili powder, smoked paprika, and a squeeze of orange juice, then quickly sear them in a hot skillet. Meanwhile, thinly slice a head of red cabbage and soak it in a mixture of apple cider vinegar, salt, and a pinch of sugar for at least 30 minutes. Warm your tortillas by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20 seconds, then assemble your tacos with a sprinkle of toasted cumin, a dollop of crema or sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro for freshness.

The straps chafed, and Max squirmed and kicked, sometimes he cried, but mostly, as they travelled, he spoke softly to the doll. In the afternoon, they passed the lake. A victory. Of course, there was only more forest, all the same. She built a fire beneath an overhanging rock; she ate jerky and apologized to Max for not feeding him. He pouted but then wandered off, picking up sticks and digging with them in the earth. The sun set. They sang to Quinn: I\u2019ll see you in the mo-or-ning. In the night, she woke and felt Max breathing against her. They followed the sun, so she called it west. Sometimes the hills they climbed would level and drop limply back down; other times, they\u2019d break through the tree line to bare rocky stretches, where eagles skimmed overhead. They travelled along a mountain ridge, two beautiful days, but had to double back when they came to a high chasm: no way down. That afternoon, they saw black bears, three of them, nosing along the mountainside. She shifted Max so he could see and said, \u201cBears.\u201d She stewed and ate nettles; she kicked mushrooms from tree trunks and roasted them. When Max put both hands into the fire, she panicked and started to shout, then stopped and let him. The trees thinned. No more big pines, only firs, growing shorter and sparser, until\u2014it happened so gradually she barely noticed\u2014they were out of the forest. The soil turned sandy and pale. Before them was nothing. Nothing whatsoever. Now and then, she\u2019d look back: the forest\u2019s edge, like a wall, and the mountains looming over it, clouds and sky above the peaks, all together like something in a fishbowl. She walked until it was only a green-blue smear, and then nothing. And then they were nowhere. On her back, Max was quiet and still. The sand was soft and felt nice on her feet. It faded to a dirty white, like smudged paper, and so did the horizon. When the lack of perspective made her dizzy, she walked with her eyes shut. They had no fires. She ran out of water. Sometimes Max whispered things in her ear. Then the last trace of gray was gone from the sand. It was fine and synthetic-feeling; when displaced, it whirled in the air with unnatural lightness. The sky darkened, and the air grew thinner; it tasted like plastic. Then the only light was behind her, as if she were walking into a cave. And soon they were in total darkness. O.K., she thought. What now. She sat down, slipped the backpack\u2019s straps over her arms, and found the lighter. Briefly, it lit the space around them. She pulled Max from her back, curled up with him, and fell asleep. When she woke, he was gone. She felt for the lighter and couldn\u2019t find it; the darkness jumped before her eyes. But then she calmed herself: he couldn\u2019t have gone far. She angled her head to listen, in one direction, then another, and on hands and knees she found the place where the sand went smooth again. In rigid, deliberate movements she crawled out, feeling with her fingers, counting each motion away from the backpack, and then returning. Wider each time, a spiral. Finally she felt a divot in the sand ahead of her, and then another. She followed the indentations out, slow and careful, the blood loud in her ears. Her fingertips found Max\u2019s cloth diaper, and then his back, his shoulders, the nape of his neck; she went into a crouch and drew her arms around him. Only later did it terrify her: he\u2019d been sitting perfectly still, staring into the dark. Back out in the light, it was the first thing she noticed: \u201cMax. Where is Quinn?\u201d She dug through the pack. \u201cQuinn,\u201d he said. She looked toward the dark, then at him, and fell into wild sobs.",
    "paragraph2": "She trudged through the dense forest, her muscles aching from the weight of Max secured to her back in a makeshift swaddle fashioned from old blankets and rope, while Quinn, the worn fabric doll, rested safely in the backpack strapped to her chest. The forest canopy filtered the sunlight, creating a dappled pattern on the leaf-strewn ground as Max's small hands occasionally reached out to grasp at low-hanging branches and colorful leaves, his delighted giggles breaking the otherwise eerie silence. As they ventured deeper into the wilderness, she remained vigilant, her eyes scanning the undergrowth for any signs of movement, knowing that various creatures called these woods home. Max would sometimes engage in animated conversations with Quinn, pulling the doll from the backpack to show it interesting findings like peculiar stones or vibrant mushrooms, while she carefully rationed their dwindling supplies, making mental notes of edible plants and water sources they encountered. The forest gradually began to thin, the lush vegetation giving way to scraggly bushes and eventually bare earth, until they found themselves at the edge of a vast, sandy expanse that stretched endlessly before them. The transition was jarring, like stepping from one world into another, and she hesitated before pressing forward into this barren landscape where the wind whispered strange songs and the sand shifted beneath their feet in unpredictable patterns. As darkness descended, the environment took on an increasingly surreal quality, with shadows bending in impossible ways and the horizon seeming to pulse and breathe like a living entity. Her exhaustion mounted as she struggled to maintain her bearings in this disorienting terrain, the weight of Max and their supplies becoming nearly unbearable. In a moment of confusion, amid swirling sand and deceiving darkness, she realized with horror that she could no longer feel Max's presence against her back. Panic seized her heart as she spun around, calling out his name into the void, until her eyes finally found him sitting perfectly still in the sand, his small figure illuminated by a strange, ambient light. Relief flooded through her as she rushed to gather him in her arms, but as they emerged from the darkness into a patch of clearer visibility, her hand instinctively reached for the front pocket of her backpack, finding it empty. Quinn, Max's constant companion and sole source of comfort in this harsh world, was gone, lost somewhere in the vast expanse of sand and shadow they had traversed. The realization hit her like a physical blow, and she collapsed to her knees, hot tears streaming down her face as Max looked on in confusion. The doll had been more than just a plaything; it had been a symbol of normalcy, a small piece of childhood preserved in a world that seemed determined to strip away all innocence and joy. She held Max close as she wept, knowing that they would have to press on without Quinn, another small loss in a journey marked by countless sacrifices, yet this one felt particularly cruel. The wind continued to blow across the desolate landscape, carrying with it the ghost of children's laughter and the memory of simpler times, as she gathered her strength to stand once more, adjusting Max's weight on her back and facing the uncertain path ahead with renewed determination, though her heart ached for the small comfort they had lost in the unforgiving darkness.",

They listened for Eykelboom ahead of them as they ran. Instead they heard his father, following. They ran in the dark on the trail that followed the creek to the crossing upstream.

They left the woods at a different spot, crossed the fence behind the Porters\u2019 yard, and peered out from the side of their house. A police cruiser was parked half on the street, half in the Eykelbooms\u2019 yard. Eykelboom\u2019s father was talking to a cop near the open door of the cruiser. His mother was there, just outside the carport, in a house robe. A couple of people stepped out of their homes, curious. Cautiously, the boys went over. Eykelboom\u2019s father stiffened when he saw them. He still had the stick in his hand. He looked at the cop, then at the boys. He said, What have you little bastards done with my boy? What have you done? I\u2019ll fucking kill you if you\u2019ve hurt him. It was hard not to run. Then Wayne said, We didn\u2019t do anything to him. What\u2019re you doing with that stick in your hand? What were you going to do to him before he ran away? What do you mean ran away? Eykelboom\u2019s father said.

Please put the stick down and go inside your house for now.",
    "paragraph2": "As they fled through the woods, the group of boys, including the pair of twins and Wayne, could hear the snapping of twigs and the labored breathing of Eykelboom's father as he pursued them, his stick at the ready. The younger twin, his legs pumping furiously as he struggled to keep up, failed to notice the barbed wire stretching across their path and tripped, his palms scraping against the rough earth. His brother quickly pulled him to his feet, and they continued running, their eyes scanning the trees for any sign of their friend Eykelboom, who had also fled to escape his father's wrath. For what felt like an hour, they searched the woods, their calls of \"Eykelboom!\" going unanswered. Eventually, they made their way back to the street, where they were met with an ominous sight: a police cruiser parked in front of the Eykelbooms' house, its lights flashing lazily. Eykelboom's father stood on the porch, his face twisted in anger as he spoke with a police officer. The boys approached cautiously, their eyes fixed on the stick still clutched in Eykelboom's father's hand. \"You're the ones who've been hurting my boy,\" he spat, his eyes flashing with accusation. Wayne stepped forward, his face set in a defiant expression. \"That's not true,\" he said, his voice steady. \"You're the one who's been beating him. That's why he ran away.\" The police officer intervened, his voice firm but calm. \"Put the stick down, sir. Let's go inside and talk about this.\" Eykelboom's father hesitated, his grip on the stick tightening before he finally relinquished it, his eyes never leaving the group of boys. The officer turned to the boys. \"You kids okay?\" he asked, his eyes scanning their faces. \"Do any of you know where Eykelboom is?\" The boys shook their heads, their faces somber with worry. As they stood there, the only sound the quiet hum of the police cruiser, they couldn't help but wonder what would happen next.",

His mother was there, just outside the carport, in a house robe. A couple of people stepped out of their homes, curious. Cautiously, the boys went over. Eykelboom\u2019s father stiffened when he saw them. He still had the stick in his hand. He looked at the cop, then at the boys. He said, What have you little bastards done with my boy? What have you done? I\u2019ll fucking kill you if you\u2019ve hurt him. It was hard not to run. Then Wayne said, We didn\u2019t do anything to him. What\u2019re you doing with that stick in your hand? What were you going to do to him before he ran away? What do you mean ran away? Eykelboom\u2019s father said. The cop peered at the boys from beneath his visor. That\u2019s right, Wayne said. He beats Ikey all the time. He made him run off. The cop\u2019s narrowed eyes moved from Wayne to the other boys to Eykelboom\u2019s father. He looked at the stick. I\u2019ll handle this, Mr. Eykelboom, the cop said. Please put the stick down and go inside your house for now.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs they fled through the woods, the group of boys, including the pair of twins and Wayne, could hear the snapping of twigs and the labored breathing of Eykelboom's father as he pursued them, his stick at the ready. The younger twin, his legs pumping furiously as he struggled to keep up, failed to notice the barbed wire stretching across their path and tripped, his palms scraping against the rough earth. His brother quickly pulled him to his feet, and they continued running, their eyes scanning the trees for any sign of their friend Eykelboom, who had also fled to escape his father's wrath. For what felt like an hour, they searched the woods, their calls of \"Eykelboom!\" going unanswered. Eventually, they made their way back to the street, where they were met with an ominous sight: a police cruiser parked in front of the Eykelbooms' house, its lights flashing lazily. Eykelboom's father stood on the porch, his face twisted in anger as he spoke with a police officer. The boys approached cautiously, their eyes fixed on the stick still clutched in Eykelboom's father's hand. \"You're the ones who've been hurting my boy,\" he spat, his eyes flashing with accusation. Wayne stepped forward, his face set in a defiant expression. \"That's not true,\" he said, his voice steady. \"You're the one who's been beating him. That's why he ran away.\" The police officer intervened, his voice firm but calm. \"Put the stick down, sir. Let's go inside and talk about this.\" Eykelboom's father hesitated, his grip on the stick tightening before he finally relinquished it, his eyes never leaving the group of boys. The officer turned to the boys. \"You kids okay?\" he asked, his eyes scanning their faces. \"Do any of you know where Eykelboom is?\" The boys shook their heads, their faces somber with worry. As they stood there, the only sound the quiet hum of the police cruiser, they couldn't help but wonder what would happen next.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

She closed her eyes, focusing on the warmth of sunlight on her skin and the soft rustling of leaves above. As she opened them again, her gaze fell on a small, iridescent pebble nestled in the grass. Its cool surface felt soothing against her palm as she picked it up, reminding her of the smooth scar tissue forming over her recent surgery site. A ladybug alighted on her knee, it's tiny legs tickling as it explored the fabric of her jeans. Sarah watched it, noting how it's vibrant red contrasted with the faded denim. In the distance, wind chimes tinkled softly, their melody mingling with the muffled sounds of life beyond the garden walls. She took a deep breath, feeling the air fill her lungs and noticing how it no longer caused her pain. As she exhaled, Sarah felt a sense of peace wash over her, realizing that in this moment, surrounded by nature's subtle wonders, she was finally beginning to heal.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

His father's breath reeked of whiskey, his mother's mascara ran in dark rivulets down her cheeks. Allistair spoke softly, trying to redirect their attention, but his words were lost in the storm of their anger. He gently tugged at his mother's sleeve, only to have her wrench her arm away, nearly knocking him off balance. His father laughed, a harsh bark that made Allistair flinch.

    "paragraph1": "As I sat quietly nursing my drink in the dimly lit pub, I couldn't help but overhear a spirited conversation from the table nearby. A group of friends was encouraging one of their own to come over and talk to me, but he seemed to brush off their suggestions with a mix of embarrassment and reluctance. My curiosity piqued, I glanced over and was immediately struck by the uncanny resemblance he bore to Patrick, a person from my past. It wasn't just the way he looked; there was something about his demeanor and the way he carried himself that reminded me of him. Both had a similar fashion sense, favoring a casual yet refined style that seemed effortlessly put together, though this man had a more rugged edge to him. As I continued to observe him, I couldn't help but compare the two: Patrick, who I remember as an academic deeply immersed in the world of Early Modern literature, and this man, whose hands and posture suggested a life of physical labor. My assumptions were confirmed later in the evening when he introduced himself as a gas engineer. Despite the differences in their lives and personalities, there was a shared authenticity in how they presented themselves. In a spontaneous moment of boldness, something quite uncharacteristic of me, I decided to break the ice and initiate a conversation. It was a risky move, one I had never dared to make before, but something about the familiarity of his presence compelled me to take that leap. Our conversation was a delightful revelation, filled with unexpected depth and warmth, bridging the gap between his technical world and the literary realm that Patrick inhabited. As we exchanged stories and laughter, I realized this encounter was not merely a coincidence but a serendipitous opportunity to reflect on the past and embrace the present.",

Every time I saw him I\u2019d feel the same shock at his likeness to Patrick. People come in physical types; I\u2019ve seen girls I immediately recognized as belonging to the same type as me: small and round with these deep-lidded frog eyes. There are dark ones and blond ones, but the type is as unmistakable as if we belonged to the same subspecies. And, even though there were specific points on which they didn\u2019t match, this man and Patrick had the same overall effect. The man in the pub was blurred where Patrick was definite. His skin was coarser. His hair wasn\u2019t as black and straight\u2014it was dark brown, with honey-brown curling bits in it. He was a little shorter than Patrick, but more muscular, as if he did physical work. He told me that he was a gas engineer, which wasn\u2019t all that physical, but presumably more strenuous than lecturing on the literature of the Early Modern period. He had a little beer belly like Patrick\u2019s. His jeans hung on his narrow hips in the same way. Actually\u2014oddly, considering how unalike their lives and personalities were\u2014they even dressed the same. They wore tight V-necked sweaters over jeans, without a shirt. They wore black T-shirts with those little cap sleeves. I suppose they had both found the styles that suited them. And soon something began that I\u2019m shocked to think of now. Something that I initiated. It would never have occurred to him even to speak to me, beyond ordering his drinks, if I hadn\u2019t started it. I didn\u2019t just flirt with him.

It wasn't that he disagreed with Wanda's assessment, but rather the fact that they were discussing Alejandro's abilities behind his back that struck a chord within him. Kiril's sudden outburst, defending Alejandro's linguistic prowess, caught the other students off guard, and the room fell silent. Realizing his fervor had made everyone uneasy, Kiril quickly apologized, attempting to diffuse the tension. The teacher, sensing an opportunity to steer the conversation back on track, introduced the class to the German word \"Krankentag,\" explaining its meaning as a sick day.

Meanwhile, the teacher played the piano alone, the melodies filling the room, but lacking the warmth of Claire's accompaniment. Alejandro's continued absence from class only added to Kiril's growing sense of monotony, leaving him longing for the unexpected events that used to punctuate his high school days. As the classes blended together, Kiril found himself yearning for something, anything, to disrupt the routine, to bring back the spark that had once made learning feel so exhilarating.

Their grip was firm as they claimed to be there for her protection, but their rough handling suggested otherwise as they dragged her toward a waiting car despite her fierce struggles and protests. The men's faces remained impassive as they forced her into the backseat, their movements practiced and efficient, suggesting this wasn't their first such operation. The car wound through the darkening streets of Berlin until it reached a hairdresser's shop in Lichtenberg, its neon sign casting an eerie glow over the wet pavement.

    "paragraph1": "I often find myself lost in thoughts about my family's history, a rich tapestry interwoven with stories and symbols that have shaped who I am today. One particular memory stands out vividly\u2014receiving a small, unassuming paperweight as a child. At first glance, it seemed like a simple object, but for me, it represented much more. It was a metaphor for the complex and intricate history of my family, a history that I have spent countless hours contemplating. I often liken our family history to grapes, each grape representing a story, a life, a moment in time that has contributed to the vast vineyard of our shared past. This metaphorical vineyard is both beautiful and burdensome, as it carries the weight of generations of love, struggle, and resilience. Nowadays, my reflections on family history are often intertwined with my anxieties about my child, Astra. I find myself consumed by an obsessive fear that Astra might choke on food\u2014a fear that has taken root deep within me and grown into a pervasive worry that I cannot seem to shake. This fear has become a point of tension between my partner, Inma, and me, as well as with Inma's mother, who frequently sides with Inma in our disagreements. Inma and I have different approaches to parenting, and my anxiety over Astra choking often leads to arguments that seem to encompass broader issues of power and love within our relationship. Inma believes that I am overly cautious and that my fears are unfounded, while I feel that my concerns are valid and that I am simply trying to protect our child. This conflict is further complicated by the involvement of Inma's mother, whose opinions often add fuel to the fire. She seems to view my concerns as an overreaction, aligning herself with Inma's more relaxed approach. In these moments, I feel isolated and misunderstood, my fears dismissed as irrational. However, my anxiety is very real to me, and it manifests in various ways, from meticulously cutting Astra's food into tiny, manageable pieces to constantly watching for any signs of distress while she eats. It's as though my fear of choking has become a focal point of my life, a lens through which I view my role as a parent and protector. This fear has caused me to question my abilities and has led to moments of self-doubt and insecurity. Despite the tension it creates, I cannot simply ignore what feels like an ever-present danger. Then, one day, I found myself in a situation that forced me to confront my own fears in a very personal way. I was enjoying a meal when, suddenly, I began to choke. In those terrifying moments, I realized how fragile life truly is and how easily the unexpected can occur. As I struggled to breathe, it dawned on me that my fear of Astra choking was not just about the act itself but about the vulnerability and lack of control that it represented. This incident served as a catalyst for introspection and self-awareness, prompting me to reconsider the dynamics at play in my relationship with Inma. I began to see that our differing beliefs about voicing fears were at the heart of many of our conflicts. Inma tends to approach life with a sense of optimism and trust, believing that voicing fears gives them power and life. In contrast, I have always felt that expressing my fears is a way to confront and manage them, to prepare for the worst so that I am not caught off guard. Our opposing viewpoints have led to misunderstandings and arguments, each of us convinced that our way is the right way. Through this experience, I realized that perhaps there is no right or wrong way, but rather a need for balance and understanding. I understood that my fear, while valid, should not overshadow the joy and spontaneity of life. Similarly, Inma's optimism should be tempered with caution and preparedness. This newfound understanding has not magically resolved our differences, but it has opened the door to more open and empathetic communication. It has allowed me to express my fears in a way that invites dialogue rather than defensiveness, and it has encouraged Inma to acknowledge my concerns without dismissing them outright. As we continue to navigate the challenges of parenthood and partnership, I am learning to let go of the need for control and to embrace the unpredictability of life. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that I cannot protect Astra from every danger, just as I cannot rewrite the past or alter my family's history. Instead, I can strive to create a nurturing and supportive environment where Astra can grow and thrive, where fears can be voiced and addressed without judgment. This journey is ongoing, and there are still moments of tension and disagreement, but I am hopeful that, with time and patience, we can find a balance that allows us to move forward together, united in our love for Astra and our commitment to one another.",
    "paragraph2": "When I was a child, somebody gave me a paperweight that contained within it an impossibly detailed forest scene, and when I think of the grapes, of how all the complexity of our family became enfolded in the grapes, I imagine that if I had lifted one of those grapes up to the light and rotated it around I would have perceived within it all of our family histories depicted in miniature, not just me and Inma in our own high chairs at the dawn of the eighties, our parents feeding us, but our own parents being fed in the forties and fifties, all the way back to our respective Old Worlds, Kyiv and San Juan, kasha or plantains, however mouths were sated and policed according to family and cultural custom, and if I kept rotating the grape I\u2019d also see Mrs. Sackett wielding her pencil of life and Mr. Kessler telling us not to practice our thrusts, all of it as intricately rendered as the shield of Achilles, or Zeuxis\u2019 grapes, which were so perfectly represented in his paintings that birds tried to eat them, birds, which sing from their syrinx, not their larynx, and cannot to my knowledge choke to death, although some can mimic human speech. When I was in charge of preparing Astra\u2019s food, I chopped everything so finely I admit I might as well have blended it or hit it with a hammer, which is not what I was supposed to be doing, I was supposed to be giving her an experience of texture, as Inma kept pointing out\u2014\u201cShe has to learn what she likes; she has to learn to use her teeth\u201d\u2014and since Inma\u2019s mother was over many times a week she often witnessed Inma remarking that I\u2019d inadvertently liquefied Astra\u2019s food, and of course Inma\u2019s mom silently sided with Inma, forming a triangle; I was the neurotic cracker with no experience caring for children who was trying to micromanage the steamed carrots, the hot dogs (which, thankfully, Astra didn\u2019t really like), and the grapes. Because Inma\u2019s mom had taught kindergarten (she\u2019d recently retired), I\u2019d hoped she might share the intensity of my concern about Astra choking\u2014surely there had been trainings about these things\u2014but although both Inma and her mother were incredibly conscientious caretakers in general, so graceful and competent with Astra that I felt bumbling in comparison, and although they watched her closely when she ate, the fear of her choking quickly became my thing, the worry I carried that carried all of my other worries: I would pulverize the food and they would not quite slice it properly, which is the way of polarization. When Inma\u2019s mom was sitting with Astra at the table, it was less that I watched over them than that my effort not to was palpable, and if Inma or her mom was cutting something for Astra I perceived a slight exaggeration in their gestures, a trace of performativity that said, See how tiny these pieces are? Do we have your permission to feed her? It was a clich\u00e9, this tension around the child\u2019s eating, the triangulation, etc., but I was finding small, mortally uncut grapes in the purple plastic snack container Inma\u2019s mom took with Astra to the park, and large grapes on the high chair that were cut in half but never lengthwise (anyway, they should be quartered), and then I\u2019d confront Inma about it, as if it were her fault, demanding she talk to her mom, and before we knew it we would be having a spectacular fight, scaling up from the grapes to questions of power, labor, value, the possibility of love, Astra crying when we yelled (or, worse, taking it all in silently, blinking her large brown eyes). We\u2019d had one such fight only a month or two before I choked. And it was only when I choked, while I was standing there choking at Caf\u00e9 Loup, that I fully realized (although not in these words) that our polarization around the grapes issued from our conflicting but, in fact, equally magical beliefs about the effects of my voicing, again and again, my fear of Astra choking. Inma would of course agree that the food should be cut up, but the intensity of my focus on this particular risk, the repetitive articulation of my concerns\u2014reading statistics off my phone (\u201cLast year alone, every child in America choked to death\u201d), showing with my thumb and index finger the tiny diameter of a child\u2019s windpipe\u2014was, in Inma\u2019s mind, courting disaster. This was both because talking about it at all invited the evil in and because too much confidence in \u201crisk management,\u201d the financialized world view of the privileged, was a kind of hubris, the fantasy that you could halve or quarter the constant threats that attended living; it was asking God, or whatever cosmic force, to cut you lengthwise down to size. Inma, then, did not speak her fears, for fear that speaking them would make them happen (that speaking them would summon one of those little tornadoes of debris); she did not, while pregnant with Astra, ever acknowledge her terror of another late miscarriage, for instance, neither to me nor, I\u2019m sure, to her mother, whereas I told my own mother constantly that the pregnan",

This newfound understanding has not magically resolved our differences, but it has opened the door to more open and empathetic communication. It has allowed me to express my fears in a way that invites dialogue rather than defensiveness, and it has encouraged Inma to acknowledge my concerns without dismissing them outright. As we continue to navigate the challenges of parenthood and partnership, I am learning to let go of the need for control and to embrace the unpredictability of life. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that I cannot protect Astra from every danger, just as I cannot rewrite the past or alter my family's history. Instead, I can strive to create a nurturing and supportive environment where Astra can grow and thrive, where fears can be voiced and addressed without judgment. This journey is ongoing, and there are still moments of tension and disagreement, but I am hopeful that, with time and patience, we can find a balance that allows us to move forward together, united in our love for Astra and our commitment to one another.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWhen I was a child, somebody gave me a paperweight that contained within it an impossibly detailed forest scene, and when I think of the grapes, of how all the complexity of our family became enfolded in the grapes, I imagine that if I had lifted one of those grapes up to the light and rotated it around I would have perceived within it all of our family histories depicted in miniature, not just me and Inma in our own high chairs at the dawn of the eighties, our parents feeding us, but our own parents being fed in the forties and fifties, all the way back to our respective Old Worlds, Kyiv and San Juan, kasha or plantains, however mouths were sated and policed according to family and cultural custom, and if I kept rotating the grape I\u2019d also see Mrs. Sackett wielding her pencil of life and Mr. Kessler telling us not to practice our thrusts, all of it as intricately rendered as the shield of Achilles, or Zeuxis\u2019 grapes, which were so perfectly represented in his paintings that birds tried to eat them, birds, which sing from their syrinx, not their larynx, and cannot to my knowledge choke to death, although some can mimic human speech. When I was in charge of preparing Astra\u2019s food, I chopped everything so finely I admit I might as well have blended it or hit it with a hammer, which is not what I was supposed to be doing, I was supposed to be giving her an experience of texture, as Inma kept pointing out\u2014\u201cShe has to learn what she likes; she has to learn to use her teeth\u201d\u2014and since Inma\u2019s mother was over many times a week she often witnessed Inma remarking that I\u2019d inadvertently liquefied Astra\u2019s food, and of course Inma\u2019s mom silently sided with Inma, forming a triangle; I was the neurotic cracker with no experience caring for children who was trying to micromanage the steamed carrots, the hot dogs (which, thankfully, Astra didn\u2019t really like), and the grapes. Because Inma\u2019s mom had taught kindergarten (she\u2019d recently retired), I\u2019d hoped she might share the intensity of my concern about Astra choking\u2014surely there had been trainings about these things\u2014but although both Inma and her mother were incredibly conscientious caretakers in general, so graceful and competent with Astra that I felt bumbling in comparison, and although they watched her closely when she ate, the fear of her choking quickly became my thing, the worry I carried that carried all of my other worries: I would pulverize the food and they would not quite slice it properly, which is the way of polarization. When Inma\u2019s mom was sitting with Astra at the table, it was less that I watched over them than that my effort not to was palpable, and if Inma or her mom was cutting something for Astra I perceived a slight exaggeration in their gestures, a trace of performativity that said, See how tiny these pieces are? Do we have your permission to feed her? It was a clich\u00e9, this tension around the child\u2019s eating, the triangulation, etc., but I was finding small, mortally uncut grapes in the purple plastic snack container Inma\u2019s mom took with Astra to the park, and large grapes on the high chair that were cut in half but never lengthwise (anyway, they should be quartered), and then I\u2019d confront Inma about it, as if it were her fault, demanding she talk to her mom, and before we knew it we would be having a spectacular fight, scaling up from the grapes to questions of power, labor, value, the possibility of love, Astra crying when we yelled (or, worse, taking it all in silently, blinking her large brown eyes). We\u2019d had one such fight only a month or two before I choked. And it was only when I choked, while I was standing there choking at Caf\u00e9 Loup, that I fully realized (although not in these words) that our polarization around the grapes issued from our conflicting but, in fact, equally magical beliefs about the effects of my voicing, again and again, my fear of Astra choking. Inma would of course agree that the food should be cut up, but the intensity of my focus on this particular risk, the repetitive articulation of my concerns\u2014reading statistics off my phone (\u201cLast year alone, every child in America choked to death\u201d), showing with my thumb and index finger the tiny diameter of a child\u2019s windpipe\u2014was, in Inma\u2019s mind, courting disaster. This was both because talking about it at all invited the evil in and because too much confidence in \u201crisk management,\u201d the financialized world view of the privileged, was a kind of hubris, the fantasy that you could halve or quarter the constant threats that attended living; it was asking God, or whatever cosmic force, to cut you lengthwise down to size. Inma, then, did not speak her fears, for fear that speaking them would make them happen (that speaking them would summon one of those little tornadoes of debris); she did not, while pregnant with Astra, ever acknowledge her terror of another late miscarriage, for instance, neither to me nor, I\u2019m sure, to her mother, whereas I told my own mother constantly that the pregnan\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "As Dr. R. K. Smile sat in his opulent office, surrounded by the trappings of a life built on questionable ethics, he couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement at the prospect of a new opportunity. A tip had come his way, whispering of a chance to meet the famous actress, Miss Salma R., a woman whose beauty and talent had captivated the hearts of millions, including that of his poor relation, Quichotte. Dr. Smile's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he thought of the potential benefits this meeting could bring, not just for himself, but for Quichotte, who had been pining for the actress for what felt like an eternity. Quichotte, a man with a heart full of love and a soul full of determination, had traveled across the vast expanse of the United States, from the sun-kissed deserts of the west to the concrete jungle of New York, all in the hopes of catching a glimpse of his beloved Miss Salma R. Now, as he sat in his cramped, dingy hotel room, surrounded by the detritus of a life on the move, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unworthiness, a nagging doubt that he was somehow less than deserving of the actress's attention. It was a feeling that had become all too familiar for Quichotte, one that he had grown accustomed to, but never truly accepted. And so, when a mysterious message arrived from Dr. Smile, requesting a meeting in the heart of Central Park, Quichotte's curiosity was piqued. What could Dr. Smile want with him? What news could he possibly have to share? The questions swirled in Quichotte's mind like a maelstrom, pulling him in with an otherworldly force. As he made his way through the crowded streets of Manhattan, the towering skyscrapers looming above him like giants, Quichotte couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to change in ways he couldn't yet imagine. The meeting with Dr. Smile was a revelation, a glimpse into a world that Quichotte had only ever caught glimpses of. Dr. Smile, resplendent in his tailored suit and gleaming gold watch, seemed every inch the confident, self-assured man that Quichotte had always known him to be. But as they walked through the park, the sounds of the city fading into the background, Dr. Smile's mask began to slip, revealing a man troubled by the weight of his own making. He spoke of the recent raid on his wife's social gathering, the accusations of corruption that had been leveled against him, and the frustration that had been building inside him like a powder keg. \"I've enriched so many people, Quichotte,\" Dr. Smile exclaimed, his voice rising in indignation. \"I've given them the keys to the kingdom, and this is how they repay me? By betraying me, by turning on me like a pack of wolves?\" Quichotte listened, entranced, as Dr. Smile defended his actions, dismissing the allegations of corruption as nothing more than a cultural norm. \"This is how business is done, Quichotte,\" he said, his eyes glinting with a mixture of defiance and desperation. \"This is how the game is played. And I've played it better than most.\" Despite his bravado, however, Dr. Smile was clearly a man on the ropes, his confidence shaken by the recent turn of events. And yet, even as he spoke of his troubles, there was a hint of something else, a sense that he was holding something back, something",

K. Smile actually laughed out loud and clapped his hands. \u201cArr\u00e9, kya baat! \u201d he cried out in the privacy of his home office. \u201cWhoa, what a thing!\u201d Because now, if it all worked out as he hoped, he just might be able to make his poor relation\u2019s impossible dream come true, if only for a moment, before the tragic inevitable occurred. He might find it in his power, and in his heart, to bring fantasy-besotted old Quichotte face to face with his lady love. Quichotte, arriving in Manhattan at the end of a long journey\u2014his quest toward Miss Salma R. had led him through Tulsa, Oklahoma; Beautiful, Kansas; Cleveland, Ohio; Bunyan, Pennsylvania; Chaucer, New Jersey; and Huckleberry, New York\u2014felt like a snail coming out of its shell. Here was bustle and thrum, hustle and flow, everything he had spent the better part of his life recoiling from, concealing himself instead in the heart of the country, leading a small life among other small lives. Now he was back in the big room, at the high rollers\u2019 table, betting the farm on love. He found accommodation in the Blue Yorker hotel, which stood conveniently just a couple of blocks from the tunnel exit, a hundred and three dollars a night, including parking, excellent value, no I.D. demanded, no questions asked, cash money required in advance, and only when he entered his Oriental Delights-themed room did he understand that he was in one of the city\u2019s numerous no-tell motels, with six free porno channels on the TV. There was adjustable mood lighting. There were strategically placed mirrors. The night was full of noises, of pleasure, pain, and painful pleasure. It was hard to sleep soundly. But, in the days that followed, Quichotte was pensive and sad. He stayed in his room watching TV (not the porno channels). He did not go to stand outside Miss Salma R.\u2019s apartment building, or outside her office slash studio, in the hope of glimpsing the woman whose heart he had come to the city to win. \u201cThere is still much to be done before I am worthy of her presence,\u201d he told himself, and then, seemingly, did nothing. The path to the Beloved was closed, even when he was so near to her, and he did not know how to open it. Then, unexpectedly, he received a mysterious series of texts from his cousin and erstwhile employer, asking where he was, seeming unsurprised when he confirmed that he was in New York, and requesting an immediate meeting by an old red-oak tree near the Hans Christian Andersen statue in Central Park. He went to the Park and Dr. Smile was waiting for him. Hat, coat, small leather attach\u00e9 case, like an Old World medico doing his rounds. But there had been a transformation in his state of mind. He was no longer the warm and gleeful man Quichotte remembered. \u201cBest of cousins!\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s walk a little,\u201d Dr. Smile said. His mood, Quichotte noted with regret, was foul. \u201cThere has been an event today in Atlanta,\u201d Dr. Smile said as they walked in the general direction of the boathouse. \u201cA shocking event, may I say. An offensive event concerning my good wife.\u201d \u201cMrs. Happy?\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cThat is indeed unexpected and woeful news! I hope she has not met with a misfortune?\u201d \u201c \u2018Misfortune\u2019 is too mild a word,\u201d Dr. Smile said grimly. \u201cI will tell you what has happened. I have a need to tell someone, and I believe I can talk to you\u2014because, to put it bluntly, you are nobody, you know nobody, so you can tell nobody who is anybody, and, plus, you are borderline simple as well.\u201d This remark\u2014its tone very unlike the kind manner with which his cousin had always spoken to him\u2014struck Quichotte as harsh and, in part, incorrect. \u201cBut everybody is somebody,\u201d he replied mildly. \u201cAlthough the language can be confusing.

K. Smile sat in his opulent office, surrounded by the trappings of a life built on questionable ethics, he couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement at the prospect of a new opportunity. A tip had come his way, whispering of a chance to meet the famous actress, Miss Salma R., a woman whose beauty and talent had captivated the hearts of millions, including that of his poor relation, Quichotte. Dr. Smile's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he thought of the potential benefits this meeting could bring, not just for himself, but for Quichotte, who had been pining for the actress for what felt like an eternity. Quichotte, a man with a heart full of love and a soul full of determination, had traveled across the vast expanse of the United States, from the sun-kissed deserts of the west to the concrete jungle of New York, all in the hopes of catching a glimpse of his beloved Miss Salma R. Now, as he sat in his cramped, dingy hotel room, surrounded by the detritus of a life on the move, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unworthiness, a nagging doubt that he was somehow less than deserving of the actress's attention. It was a feeling that had become all too familiar for Quichotte, one that he had grown accustomed to, but never truly accepted. And so, when a mysterious message arrived from Dr. Smile, requesting a meeting in the heart of Central Park, Quichotte's curiosity was piqued. What could Dr. Smile want with him? What news could he possibly have to share? The questions swirled in Quichotte's mind like a maelstrom, pulling him in with an otherworldly force. As he made his way through the crowded streets of Manhattan, the towering skyscrapers looming above him like giants, Quichotte couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to change in ways he couldn't yet imagine. The meeting with Dr. Smile was a revelation, a glimpse into a world that Quichotte had only ever caught glimpses of. Dr. Smile, resplendent in his tailored suit and gleaming gold watch, seemed every inch the confident, self-assured man that Quichotte had always known him to be. But as they walked through the park, the sounds of the city fading into the background, Dr. Smile's mask began to slip, revealing a man troubled by the weight of his own making. He spoke of the recent raid on his wife's social gathering, the accusations of corruption that had been leveled against him, and the frustration that had been building inside him like a powder keg. \"I've enriched so many people, Quichotte,\" Dr. Smile exclaimed, his voice rising in indignation. \"I've given them the keys to the kingdom, and this is how they repay me? By betraying me, by turning on me like a pack of wolves?\" Quichotte listened, entranced, as Dr. Smile defended his actions, dismissing the allegations of corruption as nothing more than a cultural norm. \"This is how business is done, Quichotte,\" he said, his eyes glinting with a mixture of defiance and desperation. \"This is how the game is played. And I've played it better than most.\" Despite his bravado, however, Dr. Smile was clearly a man on the ropes, his confidence shaken by the recent turn of events. And yet, even as he spoke of his troubles, there was a hint of something else, a sense that he was holding something back, something\n\nParagraph 2:\nWhen a whisper reached him, the faintest murmur from one of his top, inner-circle speakers\u2019-bureau doctors, that a certain Indian movie actress turned American daytime-TV superstar might appreciate a house call, Dr. R. K. Smile actually laughed out loud and clapped his hands. \u201cArr\u00e9, kya baat! \u201d he cried out in the privacy of his home office. \u201cWhoa, what a thing!\u201d Because now, if it all worked out as he hoped, he just might be able to make his poor relation\u2019s impossible dream come true, if only for a moment, before the tragic inevitable occurred. He might find it in his power, and in his heart, to bring fantasy-besotted old Quichotte face to face with his lady love. Quichotte, arriving in Manhattan at the end of a long journey\u2014his quest toward Miss Salma R. had led him through Tulsa, Oklahoma; Beautiful, Kansas; Cleveland, Ohio; Bunyan, Pennsylvania; Chaucer, New Jersey; and Huckleberry, New York\u2014felt like a snail coming out of its shell. Here was bustle and thrum, hustle and flow, everything he had spent the better part of his life recoiling from, concealing himself instead in the heart of the country, leading a small life among other small lives. Now he was back in the big room, at the high rollers\u2019 table, betting the farm on love. He found accommodation in the Blue Yorker hotel, which stood conveniently just a couple of blocks from the tunnel exit, a hundred and three dollars a night, including parking, excellent value, no I.D. demanded, no questions asked, cash money required in advance, and only when he entered his Oriental Delights-themed room did he understand that he was in one of the city\u2019s numerous no-tell motels, with six free porno channels on the TV.

The lack of curtains, which I had always taken for granted as a necessary aspect of any home, left me feeling exposed and vulnerable. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, I found myself growing accustomed to the openness of the space. Hana, the owner of this unique abode, seems to embody the same spirit of openness and freedom that her home exudes.

They must assume that I am the owner, that I am the one with the wealth and the taste to curate such a collection. But the truth is far from it. I am merely a temporary resident, a refugee from a marriage that ended and a life that I no longer wanted. I brought with me only a few personal items, which seem out of place among Hana's artfully arranged decor.

The blue, mosquito-y night pushes in from the hotel windows. Outside the bar, Rolph is suddenly less tired.

Rolph turns to Mindy. \u201cWhat are we up to?\u201d \u201cEnjoying the night,\u201d she says, still facing the mountains, but her voice is tense. \u201cWe should go up,\u201d she tells Rolph, and walks abruptly back inside. Rolph is troubled by her rudeness. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d he asks Albert. \u201cWhy not?\u201d As the three of them ascend the stairs, Rolph feels an odd pressure to make conversation. \u201cIs your room up here, too?\u201d he asks. \u201cDown the hall,\u201d Albert says. \u201cRoom 3.\u201d Mindy unlocks the door to Rolph\u2019s room and steps in, leaving Albert in the hall. Rolph is suddenly angry with her. \u201cWant to see my room?\u201d he asks Albert. \u201cMine and Charlie\u2019s?\u201d Mindy emits a single syllable of laughter\u2014the way his mother laughs when things have annoyed her to the point of absurdity. Albert steps into his room. It\u2019s plain, with wooden furniture and dusty flowered curtains, but after ten nights in tents it feels lavish. \u201cVery nice,\u201d Albert says. Mindy crosses her arms and stares out the window. There is a feeling in the room that Rolph can\u2019t identify. He\u2019s angry with Mindy and thinks that Albert must be, too. Women are crazy. Mindy\u2019s body is slender and elastic; she could slip through a keyhole, or under a door. Her thin purple sweater rises and falls quickly as she breathes. Rolph is surprised by how angry he is. Albert taps a cigarette from his pack, but doesn\u2019t light it. It is unfiltered, tobacco emerging from both ends. \u201cWell,\u201d he says. \u201cGood night, you two.\u201d Rolph had imagined Mindy tucking him into bed, her arm around him as it was in the jeep. Now this seems out of the question. He can\u2019t change into his pajamas with Mindy there; he doesn\u2019t even want her to see his pajamas, which have small blue elves all over them. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he tells her, hearing the coldness in his voice. \u201cYou can go back.\u201d \u201cO.K.,\u201d she says. She turns down his bed, plumps the pillow, adjusts the open window. Rolph senses her finding reasons not to leave the room. \u201cYour dad and I will be just next door,\u201d Mindy says. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d \u201cDuh,\u201d he mutters.

But as the story wore on, Rolph began to feel restless, his attention wandering to the other children playing in the adjacent room. It was then that Mindy, with a warm smile, offered to walk him upstairs, suggesting it was getting late and he must be tired. Rolph agreed, feeling a sense of relief wash over him as he bid his father and Ramsey goodnight. As they stepped outside onto the porch, the cool evening air enveloped him, and he felt a sense of freedom from the chaos of the other children. He breathed deeply, savoring the quiet, but his respite was short-lived. Albert, a tall, lanky figure with a mop of messy hair, appeared from the shadows, his eyes fixed intently on Rolph. Mindy's demeanor changed instantly, her body tensing as she suggested they head back inside, her voice low and urgent. Rolph felt a pang of trouble, sensing that something was amiss, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.As they made their way upstairs, Rolph felt a growing sense of pressure to converse with Albert, who had fallen into step beside them. He struggled to think of something to say, but his mind was a blank, and he was relieved when they finally reached his room. But as they entered, Rolph noticed that Mindy seemed annoyed, her eyes flashing with irritation as she busied herself tidying up his toys. He was taken aback by his own anger towards her, feeling a surge of resentment that he couldn't explain. Albert, seemingly oblivious to the tension, chatted on, asking Rolph about his favorite books and games. But as the minutes ticked by, Rolph found himself growing increasingly cold towards Mindy, his responses to Albert's questions becoming more and more monosyllabic. Eventually, Albert took the hint and bid Rolph goodnight, leaving him alone with Mindy. \"You can go back downstairs now,\" Rolph said curtly, not looking up from the book he had picked up. But Mindy lingered, making small adjustments to the room, fluffing up his pillows and straightening his bedspread. \"We're just downstairs, Rolph,\" she said softly, her voice a gentle reminder that she and his father were nearby. Rolph felt a pang of guilt at his earlier behavior, and his tone softened as he replied, \"I know, Mindy. Thanks.\" As she smiled and slipped out of the room, Rolph was left to ponder the complex emotions that had swirled inside him, his interactions with Mindy and Albert leaving him feeling both confused and relieved.",

Toby, recently exposed to classic films, threw me a curve ball by quoting \"Trading Places\" with surprising timing, making me wonder if I was fighting a losing battle. The mention of Michael made me pause and reflect on our friendship, a relationship that had weathered decades of changes. Here was a man who had built his fortune from scratch, amassing wealth that would make most people's heads spin, yet he remained remarkably unchanged by it all. It was this quality that earned him not just respect but genuine admiration from everyone who knew him.

And, if they were actually to read the text, what would they make of it? No more than I could. Here I stopped transcribing names to leaf through the manuscript itself, in the hope of gaining some glimmer of understanding. There was none; it remained turgid and incomprehensible to me and in no way reflected the man I had seen lying indolently under a tree. I put the list in an envelope with a note to say that I hoped it would be useful to him. I knocked on his door and, receiving no answer, pushed it open.

These same people who once hung on my every word at dinner parties would now likely dismiss this as just another piece of junk mail, wedged between grocery store circulars and credit card offers. The manuscript sitting on my desk remains stubbornly cryptic, its dense passages refusing to yield their secrets, which seems at odds with my mental image of Dr. Chacko\u2014relaxed, approachable, nothing like the complexity of these written words. After meticulously assembling the list of names, I feel almost like a conspiracy theorist as I make my way to Dr. Chacko's cottage, the envelope containing my carefully curated contacts feeling oddly weighted in my hands. The empty cottage stands as a silent witness to my furtive mission, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm participating in something clandestine as I slip the envelope through the mail slot. When Betty appears at my door the next morning, her face etched with an uncharacteristic gravity and my list clutched in her hand, I realize that my simple act of compilation has set something in motion that I hadn't anticipated, something that makes me question the wisdom of bridging these two worlds\u2014my past and my present.",

The cottage was empty, not only of him but of any presence whatsoever: there was nothing except my abandoned furniture and the fan I had given him\u2014no photographs, no pictures, nothing personal. I put the envelope on the table and left quickly, as though I were doing something underhanded. My instinct turned out to be correct: the next day, Betty came to see me, looking grave and holding the list in her hand.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThumbing through my old address book feels like excavating artifacts from another life\u2014one filled with cocktail parties, gallery openings, and endless social obligations that now seem like scenes from someone else's movie. The irony isn't lost on me as I sit here, compiling names for Dr. Chacko's flyer distribution, imagining my former acquaintances' perfectly manicured hands tossing it into their recycling bins without a second glance. These same people who once hung on my every word at dinner parties would now likely dismiss this as just another piece of junk mail, wedged between grocery store circulars and credit card offers. The manuscript sitting on my desk remains stubbornly cryptic, its dense passages refusing to yield their secrets, which seems at odds with my mental image of Dr. Chacko\u2014relaxed, approachable, nothing like the complexity of these written words. After meticulously assembling the list of names, I feel almost like a conspiracy theorist as I make my way to Dr. Chacko's cottage, the envelope containing my carefully curated contacts feeling oddly weighted in my hands. The empty cottage stands as a silent witness to my furtive mission, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm participating in something clandestine as I slip the envelope through the mail slot. When Betty appears at my door the next morning, her face etched with an uncharacteristic gravity and my list clutched in her hand, I realize that my simple act of compilation has set something in motion that I hadn't anticipated, something that makes me question the wisdom of bridging these two worlds\u2014my past and my present.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

No, you don\u2019t have to say anything. It\u2019s a fact, and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d Ursula nodded. A jarring fact could never be softened by words. \u201cDid they die together?\u201d she asked.

They could look for clues, but they would not have the facts. No wonder Lilian had wanted to find a quiet place in the English countryside, where a cabdriver told fairy tales about criminal America. Very few deaths could remain private. In that sense, Ursula counted herself fortunate: Edmund\u2019s death, so public, nevertheless had left her safe in her bereavement. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDid the second child\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

As Ursula listened with careful attention, Lilian revealed the devastating truth that had reshaped her entire existence: both of her sons had taken their own lives, a fact she had somehow learned to carry within her daily life. Though hesitant, Ursula gently probed further, her natural curiosity tempered by compassion as she asked about the circumstances surrounding their deaths. Lilian's response was measured but heavy with unspoken pain as she explained that her sons had died years apart, both still in the spring of their youth. The public spectacle of death, with its formal announcements and societal rituals, stood in stark contrast to the private anguish that followed, a reality that resonated deeply with Ursula, who carried her own grief for Edmund. As their conversation continued, the weight of Lilian's loss became increasingly palpable, particularly when she confessed that Trevor's stories, once a source of solace and escape, now seemed permanently beyond her reach. The raw reality of her experience had created an insurmountable barrier between her and the fictional worlds she once inhabited, leaving her to grapple with a pain so profound it defied the comfort of literature. In this shared moment of vulnerability, both women recognized the universal yet deeply personal nature of grief, understanding how it could transform not only one's relationship with the world but also with the art and stories that once served as sanctuary.",

It was a challenging time, but with their support, I slowly began to heal. The day finally came when I was declared out of danger, and the relief was palpable - at least for everyone around me. I, on the other hand, felt a mix of emotions, unsure of what the future held. I recall walking into the room, shedding my outdoor clothing, and my godmother Georgie remarking on my appearance, which I found unnecessary and a bit annoying. I made my way to the white sofa, where my father was sitting, and plopped down beside him, feeling a sense of comfort and security. Georgie settled into the identical sofa across from us, the low table between us holding a decanter, glasses, and a stack of magazines. Her ashtrays, always a testament to her heavy smoking habit, were scattered about. My mind began to wander, and I thought back to a previous visit when I had accidentally left a shoe polish mark on the sofa - perhaps the last time my mother and Georgie had been together. The memory was bittersweet, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia wash over me. As I sat there, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home and family, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the journey, difficult as it was, that had brought me to this moment.",

Divested of hat, scarf, coat, overshoes, and leggings, grasping the handkerchief pressed in my hand so I would not interrupt later by asking for one, responding to my father\u2019s muttered \u201cFix your hair,\u201d struck by the command because it was he who had told me not to use \u201cfix\u201d in that sense, I was finally able to sit down next to him on a white sofa. My godmother occupied its twin. A low table stood between, bearing a decanter and glasses and a pile of magazines and, of course, Georgie\u2019s ashtrays; I think she smoked even more than my mother did. On one of these sofas, during an earlier visit with my mother and father, the backs of my dangling feet had left a smudge of shoe polish. It may have been the last occasion when my mother and Georgie were ever together.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I sit here reflecting on that trying period of my life, I am reminded of the psychosomatic guardian angel who watched over me during my recovery from illness. It was a challenging time, but with their support, I slowly began to heal. The day finally came when I was declared out of danger, and the relief was palpable - at least for everyone around me. I, on the other hand, felt a mix of emotions, unsure of what the future held. I recall walking into the room, shedding my outdoor clothing, and my godmother Georgie remarking on my appearance, which I found unnecessary and a bit annoying. I made my way to the white sofa, where my father was sitting, and plopped down beside him, feeling a sense of comfort and security. Georgie settled into the identical sofa across from us, the low table between us holding a decanter, glasses, and a stack of magazines. Her ashtrays, always a testament to her heavy smoking habit, were scattered about. My mind began to wander, and I thought back to a previous visit when I had accidentally left a shoe polish mark on the sofa - perhaps the last time my mother and Georgie had been together. The memory was bittersweet, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of nostalgia wash over me. As I sat there, surrounded by the familiar comforts of home and family, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the journey, difficult as it was, that had brought me to this moment.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

My father, a seasoned doctor with years of experience, seemed to sense my hesitation and gave me a reassuring nod as he began to explain the procedure. We were going to be performing a dilation and curettage, a relatively routine procedure, but one that still made me feel a bit uneasy. The patient, a young woman named Madeleine, was already lying on the examination table, her eyes fixed on the ceiling as she tried to calm her racing heart. My father handed me a pair of gloves and instructed me to hold Madeleine's knees steady, which I did, trying to offer her a reassuring smile as I did so.As the procedure began, I couldn't help but notice the look of distress on Madeleine's face. She was shivering and clenching her teeth, her eyes welling up with tears as my father worked. I tried to distract her with conversation, asking her about her interests and hobbies, but she was too caught up in her own pain and discomfort to respond. My father worked quickly and efficiently, his hands moving with a precision that came from years of practice, but even he couldn't hide the look of weariness that had been etched on his face for weeks. It had been a long and difficult few months, with Mrs. Barrie's injury and a heavier-than-usual patient load taking its toll on him. I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt as I watched him work, knowing that I was planning to leave soon, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, and wondering who would be there to help him when I was gone.Despite the difficulties of the procedure, my father worked tirelessly, his focus solely on Madeleine and her well-being. I watched in awe as he expertly navigated the complexities of the human body, his hands moving with a gentle precision that belied the difficulty of the task at hand. As the procedure drew to a close, Madeleine's distress began to subside, replaced by a look of relief and exhaustion. My father smiled wearily and patted her hand, offering her words of comfort and reassurance as he helped her sit up and begin the slow process of recovery. As I watched, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for my father, who had dedicated his life to helping others, often at great personal cost.As the procedure came to an end and Madeleine was helped off the examination table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. It had been a difficult and trying experience, but we had gotten through it, and Madeleine was on the road to recovery. My father smiled wearily and thanked me for my help, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he did so. I smiled back, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment at having been able to assist him, even if it was just in a small way. As we cleaned up the examination room and prepared for the next patient, I couldn't help but think about the future, and the possibilities that lay ahead. I had always known that I wanted to leave, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, but now I wasn't so sure. My father needed me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was abandoning him by leaving.",
    "paragraph2": "Tonight he knocked on my door. He knocked though it wasn\u2019t all the way closed. I was reading. He asked\u2014not in a supplicating way of course but I would say with reasonable respect\u2014if I could give him a hand in the office. The first special since Mrs. B. has been away. I asked what he wanted me to do. \u201cJust more or less to keep her steady,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s young and she\u2019s not used to it yet. Give your hands a good scrub, too. Use the soap in the bottle in the toilet downstairs.\u201d The patient was lying flat on the examining table with a sheet over her from the waist down. The top part of her was fully dressed in a dark-blue buttoned-up cardigan and a white blouse with a lace-trimmed collar. These clothes lay loosely over her sharp collarbone and nearly flat chest. Her hair was black, pulled tightly back from her face and braided and pinned on top of her head. This prim and severe style made her neck look long and emphasized the regal bone structure of her white face, so that from a distance she could be taken for a woman of forty-five. Close up you could see that she was quite young, probably around twenty. Her pleated skirt was hung up on the back of the door. I could see the rim of white panties that she had thoughtfully hung underneath. She was shivering hard though the office wasn\u2019t cold. \u201cNow, Madeleine,\u201d my father said. \u201cThe first thing is we\u2019ve got to get your knees up.\u201d I wondered if he knew her. Or did he just ask for a name and use whatever the woman gave him? \u201cEasy,\u201d he said. \u201cEasy. Easy.\u201d He got the stirrups in place and her feet into them. She was still wearing her loafers. Her knees shook so much in this new position that they clapped together. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hold steadier than that,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou know, now, I can\u2019t do my job unless you do yours. Do you want a blanket over you?\u201d He said to me, \u201cGet her a blanket. Off the bottom shelf there.\u201d I arranged the blanket to cover the top part of Madeleine\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t look at me. Her teeth rattled. She clenched her mouth shut. \u201cNow, just slide down this way a bit,\u201d my father said. And to me, \u201cHold her knees. Get them apart. Just hold her easy.\u201d I put my hands on the knobs of the girl\u2019s knees and moved them apart as gently as I could. My father\u2019s breathing filled the room with its busy unintelligible comments. I had to hold Madeleine\u2019s knees quite firmly to keep them from jerking together. \u201cWhere\u2019s that old woman?\u201d she said. I said, \u201cShe\u2019s at home. She had a fall. I\u2019m here instead.\u201d So she had been here before. \u201cShe\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. Her voice was matter-of-fact, almost a growl, not so nervous as I would have expected from the agitation of her body. My father had picked up a thin rod like a knitting needle. \u201cNow. This is the hard part,\u201d he said. He spoke in a conversational tone, milder I think than any I have ever heard from him. \u201cAnd the more you tighten up the harder it will be. So just\u2014easy. There. Easy. Good girl. Good girl.\u201d I was trying to think of something to say that would ease her or distract her. I could see now what my father was doing. Laid out on a white cloth on the table beside him he had a series of rods, all of the same length but of a graduated thickness. These were what he would use, one after the other, to open and stretch the cervix. From my station behind the sheeted barrier beyond the girl\u2019s knees, I could not see the actual, intimate progress of these instruments. But I could feel it, from the arriving waves of pain in her body that beat down the spasms of apprehension and actually made her quieter. Where are you from? Where did you go to school? Do you have a job? (I had noticed a wedding ring, but quite possibly they all wore wedding rings.) Do you have any brothers or sisters? Why should she want to answer any of that, even if she weren\u2019t in pain? She sucked her breath back through her teeth and widened her eyes at the ceiling. \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cGetting there,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl. Good quiet girl. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d I said, \u201cI was going to paint this room, but I never got around to it. If you were going to paint it, what color would you choose?\u201d \u201cHoh,\u201d said Madeleine. \u201cHoh.\u201d A sudden startled expulsion of breath. \u201cHoh. Hoh.\u201d \u201cYellow?\u201d I said. \u201cI thought a light yellow. Or a light green?\u201d By the time we got to the thickest rod Madeleine had thrust her head back into the flat cushion, stretching out her long neck, and stretching her mouth, too, lips wide and tight over her teeth. \u201cThink of your favorite movie. What is your favorite movie?\u201d A nurse said that to me, just as I reached the unbelievable interminable plateau of pain and was convinced that relief would not come, not this time. How could movies exist anymore in the world? Now I\u2019d said the same thing to Madeleine and Madeleine\u2019s eyes flicked over me with the coldly distracted expression of someone who sees that a human being can be about as much use as a stopped clock. I risked taking one hand off her knee and touched her han",

However, his holiday cheer was starkly contrasted by the distressing scene unfolding before him. Charlotte, her eyes streaked with mascara and her stockings marred by a noticeable run, clung to Gerald, her body shaking with sobs as she cried against his lapel. Her emotional state was further exacerbated by her disheveled appearance, a testament to the turmoil brewing within. Gerald, attempting to offer comfort, suggested they grab a drink, gently guiding her out of the building as they exchanged holiday greetings with the doorman. Once outside, Charlotte's emotional outburst continued, with her accusing Gerald of being disoriented and insisting they head to Rockefeller Center to witness the Christmas tree lighting. Her frustration stemmed from having spent the evening alone, a fact that only added to her already fragile state. As Gerald attempted to support her by placing a reassuring arm around her shoulders, her unsteady gait forced him to hold her hand instead, a gesture that seemed to offer a semblance of stability in the midst of her emotional turmoil.",

However, his holiday cheer was starkly contrasted by the distressing scene unfolding before him. Charlotte, her eyes streaked with mascara and her stockings marred by a noticeable run, clung to Gerald, her body shaking with sobs as she cried against his lapel. Her emotional state was further exacerbated by her disheveled appearance, a testament to the turmoil brewing within. Gerald, attempting to offer comfort, suggested they grab a drink, gently guiding her out of the building as they exchanged holiday greetings with the doorman. Once outside, Charlotte's emotional outburst continued, with her accusing Gerald of being disoriented and insisting they head to Rockefeller Center to witness the Christmas tree lighting. Her frustration stemmed from having spent the evening alone, a fact that only added to her already fragile state. As Gerald attempted to support her by placing a reassuring arm around her shoulders, her unsteady gait forced him to hold her hand instead, a gesture that seemed to offer a semblance of stability in the midst of her emotional turmoil.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTodd Browne exited the elevator, whistling, as Charlotte moved in for a second, firmer embrace of Gerald. \u201cMerry, merry,\u201d Todd said, nodding as he passed.

    "paragraph1": "During a typical Sunday lunch, my mother and I found ourselves in the midst of a conversation that veered from the mundane to the unexpectedly intriguing, with our discussion centering on a recent burglary at my home. As we sat at the dining table, the familiar aroma of roasted chicken and potatoes wafting through the air, my mother, ever the skeptic, expressed her deep-seated distrust of locksmiths. She posited that the burglar might have had some knowledge of old optical equipment, given the peculiar items that were stolen. Her eyes twinkled with a mix of concern and excitement, an unusual combination that hinted at her secret delight in applying her extensive crime novel knowledge to a real-life scenario. She suggested that I take a trip to the local flea market, notoriously known as the \"Thieves' Market,\" to see if any of my stolen items might turn up there. It was a place she had heard about from her friend Rita, who had gained a reputation for helping people recover their stolen belongings without expecting anything in return. Intrigued by the prospect, I listened as my mother recounted Rita's story. Rita, once a victim of burglary herself, had turned her misfortune into a mission, dedicating her time to assisting others in similar predicaments. Her altruistic efforts were fueled by her understanding of the despair that accompanied losing treasured possessions, and she found solace in the camaraderie that the market fostered among those who had been wronged. As we continued our conversation, Rita's motivations became clearer. She believed that the market served a vital role in the community, not just as a place to potentially reclaim lost items but as a beacon of hope for those left in the wake of theft. The market, she explained, was intensely local, with many of the sellers and buyers hailing from nearby neighborhoods. It was this proximity that made it an effective venue for recovering stolen goods, as it provided a direct link between the victims and the possible conduits of their misplaced belongings. Rita's perspective extended beyond the market itself, touching on broader themes of community and the gradual erosion of societal structures. She shared an article she had recently read, which explored the idea of civilizations breaking down into smaller, more manageable groups. This concept resonated with her, as she saw the market as a microcosm of this phenomenon\u2014a small, self-sustaining community that arose from the ashes of broader societal collapse. By the time our lunch plates had been cleared, I felt a curious blend of unease and optimism. The notion that my stolen items might be lurking somewhere within the bustling stalls of the \"Thieves' Market\" was both unsettling and strangely hopeful. My mother's enthusiasm for the mystery at hand, coupled with Rita's inspiring story, left me contemplating not only the fate of my possessions but also the resilience of communities in the face of adversity. As I sat there, digesting both my meal and the weighty topics we had delved into, I realized that this unexpected conversation had opened my eyes to the intricate web of human connections that often go unnoticed, but which can provide comfort and support in times of need.",
    "paragraph2": "At my mother\u2019s that Sunday\u2014we did lunch every Sunday\u2014I talked about Catapult\u2019s still mysterious anger and the locksmith\u2019s tragic childhood. My mother shared her general suspicion of locksmiths. Certainly, she said, they must have a copy of every single key to every single lock they\u2019d ever installed, or a magic key to all doors, and they entered people\u2019s homes to steal small items whose absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed for a while; worse, perhaps the locksmiths didn\u2019t steal anything, just took naps on beds that weren\u2019t theirs, drank out of people\u2019s favorite cups, shit in their toilets. Only other locksmiths ever had a clue. \u201cIn your case, though, it\u2019s not a locksmith who did the deed,\u201d my mother said. \u201cObviously. We\u2019re looking at someone who knows about old optical equipment. Did you tell the police that?\u201d My mother was glad about the burglary, in a way. She got to use all the knowledge that she\u2019d gleaned from reading crime novels for the past forty years. \u201cMaybe a former optometrist,\u201d she said, blowing her nose and folding the Kleenex neatly over the result. \u201cOr a failed one.\u201d Her building had implemented a new waste-sorting policy the previous month, and we\u2019d mostly been talking about that, so my burglary provided a welcome change of topic, at least. Just as I was thinking this, though, my mother asked which bin used tissues should go in. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering for days,\u201d she said. \u201cCan snot be recycled?\u201d \u201cWhen in doubt, throw it in the gray bin,\u201d I said. My mother doubted a lot. The gray bin was always full. \u201cI can put you in touch with my friend Rita for next week,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next week?\u201d \u201cWell, like, every Sunday, honey, there\u2019s the flea market on Pinto Square.\u201d \u201cAnd why would I go there with your friend Rita?\u201d I\u2019d never heard of Rita. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know about this!\u201d my mother said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s been burglarized goes to Pinto Square to see if their things resurface. People call it the Thieves\u2019 Market. You never heard that? China, lamps, small furniture\u2014lots of stolen property ends up there. I\u2019m surprised the cop who filed your complaint didn\u2019t tell you to go there first thing.\u201d \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t look desperate enough to get my stuff back,\u201d I said. And I wasn\u2019t. Insurance had me covered, and I\u2019d been thinking about getting rid of the TV for a while anyway\u2014I just wasn\u2019t sure how to dispose of it responsibly. \u201cOh, you\u2019re getting that case back,\u201d my mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I have left from your grandfather.\u201d \u201cI thought the watch you\u2019re wearing was his. And the desk in the library.\u201d She simply ignored this. \u201cNext Sunday,\u201d she said. \u201c9 A.M. sharp.\u201d She gave me Rita\u2019s number. Rita, to my surprise, was young. I didn\u2019t know where my mother made her friends these days. She\u2019d had a bad fall a few years earlier, and since then she\u2019d decided to limit her outings to what was strictly necessary, a category that didn\u2019t include socializing. Rita said that she was an \u201capartment therapist,\u201d which didn\u2019t help me imagine how they might\u2019ve met. My mother didn\u2019t even believe in therapy for people. Rita had told me to bring pictures of the stolen items, but I\u2019d never taken pictures of things, never really taken pictures in general, so I\u2019d pulled images of similar objects from the Internet and printed them at the office. \u201cI guess these will work,\u201d Rita said, and she sat on the ground to cut the images out and tape them (she carried scissors and tape in her purse) into a notebook deformed by dozens of other similar pasteups. My mother had told me that Rita had started coming to the market after having been burglarized herself, years before, and that, giving up on finding her own things, she\u2019d realized she knew how to navigate the place, and could be of help to the newly burglarized. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d I asked Rita. \u201cShould I pay you for every Sunday you spend looking, or only when you find something?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t your mom tell you?\u201d she said. \u201cI do this for free.\u201d Free things make me suspicious. \u201cNow, you\u2019re probably thinking a free service can\u2019t possibly be worth much,\u201d Rita said. \u201cBut I\u2019m actually pretty selfish in doing this. I just can\u2019t stand knowing that people are suffering while I could help them. There\u2019s a lot of suffering here. Your mother told me you were home when they did it? I was home, too. You\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t assaulted. I was. But, anyway, I can lighten the burden of others by showing them around, and that\u2019s payment enough. There\u2019re more than three hundred venders here\u2014it can be overwhelming at first\u2014but most of the stolen stuff that enters the market actually ends up on the same twenty to twenty-five tables, so we\u2019ll start with those.\u201d \u201cYou know which venders are most likely to resell stolen property, and you don\u2019t tell the police about it?\u201d \u201cThe police know as much as I do,\u201d Rita said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like the venders are the actual burglars.\u201d \u201cStill, they could lead you to them.\u201d \u201cArresting a couple of venders will not make the number of burglaries drop, I can tell you that much.

Just as I was thinking this, though, my mother asked which bin used tissues should go in. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering for days,\u201d she said. \u201cCan snot be recycled?\u201d \u201cWhen in doubt, throw it in the gray bin,\u201d I said. My mother doubted a lot. The gray bin was always full. \u201cI can put you in touch with my friend Rita for next week,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next week?\u201d \u201cWell, like, every Sunday, honey, there\u2019s the flea market on Pinto Square.\u201d \u201cAnd why would I go there with your friend Rita?\u201d I\u2019d never heard of Rita. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know about this!\u201d my mother said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s been burglarized goes to Pinto Square to see if their things resurface. People call it the Thieves\u2019 Market. You never heard that? China, lamps, small furniture\u2014lots of stolen property ends up there. I\u2019m surprised the cop who filed your complaint didn\u2019t tell you to go there first thing.\u201d \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t look desperate enough to get my stuff back,\u201d I said. And I wasn\u2019t. Insurance had me covered, and I\u2019d been thinking about getting rid of the TV for a while anyway\u2014I just wasn\u2019t sure how to dispose of it responsibly. \u201cOh, you\u2019re getting that case back,\u201d my mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I have left from your grandfather.\u201d \u201cI thought the watch you\u2019re wearing was his. And the desk in the library.\u201d She simply ignored this. \u201cNext Sunday,\u201d she said. \u201c9 A.M. sharp.\u201d She gave me Rita\u2019s number. Rita, to my surprise, was young. I didn\u2019t know where my mother made her friends these days. She\u2019d had a bad fall a few years earlier, and since then she\u2019d decided to limit her outings to what was strictly necessary, a category that didn\u2019t include socializing. Rita said that she was an \u201capartment therapist,\u201d which didn\u2019t help me imagine how they might\u2019ve met. My mother didn\u2019t even believe in therapy for people. Rita had told me to bring pictures of the stolen items, but I\u2019d never taken pictures of things, never really taken pictures in general, so I\u2019d pulled images of similar objects from the Internet and printed them at the office. \u201cI guess these will work,\u201d Rita said, and she sat on the ground to cut the images out and tape them (she carried scissors and tape in her purse) into a notebook deformed by dozens of other similar pasteups. My mother had told me that Rita had started coming to the market after having been burglarized herself, years before, and that, giving up on finding her own things, she\u2019d realized she knew how to navigate the place, and could be of help to the newly burglarized. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d I asked Rita. \u201cShould I pay you for every Sunday you spend looking, or only when you find something?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t your mom tell you?\u201d she said. \u201cI do this for free.\u201d Free things make me suspicious. \u201cNow, you\u2019re probably thinking a free service can\u2019t possibly be worth much,\u201d Rita said. \u201cBut I\u2019m actually pretty selfish in doing this. I just can\u2019t stand knowing that people are suffering while I could help them. There\u2019s a lot of suffering here. Your mother told me you were home when they did it? I was home, too. You\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t assaulted. I was. But, anyway, I can lighten the burden of others by showing them around, and that\u2019s payment enough. There\u2019re more than three hundred venders here\u2014it can be overwhelming at first\u2014but most of the stolen stuff that enters the market actually ends up on the same twenty to twenty-five tables, so we\u2019ll start with those.\u201d \u201cYou know which venders are most likely to resell stolen property, and you don\u2019t tell the police about it?\u201d \u201cThe police know as much as I do,\u201d Rita said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like the venders are the actual burglars.\u201d \u201cStill, they could lead you to them.\u201d \u201cArresting a couple of venders will not make the number of burglaries drop, I can tell you that much.

    "paragraph1": "In the small town of Willowdale, a peculiar phenomenon began to unfold. It all started with a lone, mischievous raccoon named Rascal, who would occasionally knock over a trash can or two on Main Street during his scavenging antics. At first, the townsfolk were amused by the raccoon, chuckling and quickly cleaning up after his mess. However, Rascal's pranks became more frequent and brazen, with him eventually stealing food from market stalls and leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. Despite the growing chaos, the townsfolk continued to downplay the issue, remaining somewhat enthralled by Rascal's \"mischievous charm\" and quietly grateful for the distraction from the usual quiet. As time passed, however, more raccoons joined Rascal's ranks, and soon the town was overrun with marauding bands of masked bandits. Shopkeepers began to leave out offerings of food, hoping to appease the raccoons and avoid trouble. Eventually, this tactic gained traction amongst the townsfolk, and Rascal's gang became accepted, if not celebrated, as the town's beloved mascots. It was almost as though the entire town of Willowdale had gradually been inoculated to the presence of the raccoons regardless of the absurd situation. The once-quiet town was now a quaint landscape, where humans tiptoed around raccoons, and the line between nuisance and norm had been irreparably blurred.",

It all started with a lone, mischievous raccoon named Rascal, who would occasionally knock over a trash can or two on Main Street during his scavenging antics. At first, the townsfolk were amused by the raccoon, chuckling and quickly cleaning up after his mess. However, Rascal's pranks became more frequent and brazen, with him eventually stealing food from market stalls and leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. Despite the growing chaos, the townsfolk continued to downplay the issue, remaining somewhat enthralled by Rascal's \"mischievous charm\" and quietly grateful for the distraction from the usual quiet. As time passed, however, more raccoons joined Rascal's ranks, and soon the town was overrun with marauding bands of masked bandits. Shopkeepers began to leave out offerings of food, hoping to appease the raccoons and avoid trouble. Eventually, this tactic gained traction amongst the townsfolk, and Rascal's gang became accepted, if not celebrated, as the town's beloved mascots. It was almost as though the entire town of Willowdale had gradually been inoculated to the presence of the raccoons regardless of the absurd situation.

It was 1973, and computers were essentially going nowhere and they were living in a grotty place in Revere, not on the beach but close to it, and all night people kept going up the stairs to buy drugs from the two sallow creatures who lived in the apartment above them and listened endlessly to dopey records from the sixties.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "Living in North Galway has been a peculiar experience, filled with moments that both amuse and perplex me. The locals here seem to carry an air of excessive sensuality, a notion that echoes historical observations, like those of Thackeray, who once commented on the behavior and attire of rural Irish women. While I find these musings amusing, John Murphy, a local acquaintance, often dismisses such romantic pursuits as relics of his past. His indifference is a stark contrast to the vibrant energy that pulses through the town. Lately, I've been contemplating selling my property and moving to Cambodia, a prospect that seems more appealing with each passing day. My thoughts, however, are interrupted by Nadia, who bursts in with a frantic account of an otter in the kitchen. True to her coldhearted nature, her panic is more about the disruption than the creature itself. When I investigate, I find the otter calmly lapping up soup, seemingly unperturbed by my presence. After some effort, I manage to shoo it outside, watching as it makes its way to higher ground rather than the usual tide-line rocks. This deviation concerns me, triggering thoughts of potential flooding. I turn to the locals for reassurance, including Bill Knott, who confidently tells me that it hasn't flooded in sixteen years and won\u2019t now. Despite his reassurances, my anxiety lingers, perhaps fueled by the quiet disdain I sense from the townsfolk. They seem to regard me as an outsider, someone who neglects their property and fails to grasp the rhythm of life here. This perception, whether true or imagined, only adds to my growing discontent.

She wasn't attracted to Paul, and that truth weighed on her every day. The reasons she stayed with him were scattered, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that didn't quite fit together. Paul was dependable, a constant in her life when everything else seemed uncertain. She had grown used to the rhythm of their days, the quiet comfort of his presence. Their conversations weren't electric, but they were honest, and that counted for something. Her mother had said love was about compromise, and Emma wondered if this was the kind of compromise she meant. There was also the sinking feeling of time slipping away, a fear of what she'd lose if she let him go. Paul adored her, and that kind of affection felt rare, like a fragile bird she was afraid to set free. She questioned herself constantly: how much did physical attraction really matter? Maybe love was about more than sparks and butterflies. She felt guilty, knowing Paul sensed her hesitations but chose to ignore them, always hopeful she would come around.

The guilt of knowing I've caused her this pain mingles with the relief of having expressed my fears, creating a complex emotional cocktail that eventually lulls me into slumber, while she continues her silent vigil, her love unwavering despite my emotional turbulence.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "Tonight he knocked on my door. He knocked though it wasn\u2019t all the way closed. I was reading. He asked\u2014not in a supplicating way of course but I would say with reasonable respect\u2014if I could give him a hand in the office. The first special since Mrs. B. has been away. I asked what he wanted me to do. \u201cJust more or less to keep her steady,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s young and she\u2019s not used to it yet. Give your hands a good scrub, too. Use the soap in the bottle in the toilet downstairs.\u201d The patient was lying flat on the examining table with a sheet over her from the waist down. The top part of her was fully dressed in a dark-blue buttoned-up cardigan and a white blouse with a lace-trimmed collar. These clothes lay loosely over her sharp collarbone and nearly flat chest. Her hair was black, pulled tightly back from her face and braided and pinned on top of her head. This prim and severe style made her neck look long and emphasized the regal bone structure of her white face, so that from a distance she could be taken for a woman of forty-five. Close up you could see that she was quite young, probably around twenty. Her pleated skirt was hung up on the back of the door. I could see the rim of white panties that she had thoughtfully hung underneath. She was shivering hard though the office wasn\u2019t cold. \u201cNow, Madeleine,\u201d my father said. \u201cThe first thing is we\u2019ve got to get your knees up.\u201d I wondered if he knew her. Or did he just ask for a name and use whatever the woman gave him? \u201cEasy,\u201d he said. \u201cEasy. Easy.\u201d He got the stirrups in place and her feet into them. She was still wearing her loafers. Her knees shook so much in this new position that they clapped together. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hold steadier than that,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou know, now, I can\u2019t do my job unless you do yours. Do you want a blanket over you?\u201d He said to me, \u201cGet her a blanket. Off the bottom shelf there.\u201d I arranged the blanket to cover the top part of Madeleine\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t look at me. Her teeth rattled. She clenched her mouth shut. \u201cNow, just slide down this way a bit,\u201d my father said. And to me, \u201cHold her knees. Get them apart. Just hold her easy.\u201d I put my hands on the knobs of the girl\u2019s knees and moved them apart as gently as I could. My father\u2019s breathing filled the room with its busy unintelligible comments. I had to hold Madeleine\u2019s knees quite firmly to keep them from jerking together. \u201cWhere\u2019s that old woman?\u201d she said. I said, \u201cShe\u2019s at home. She had a fall. I\u2019m here instead.\u201d So she had been here before. \u201cShe\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. Her voice was matter-of-fact, almost a growl, not so nervous as I would have expected from the agitation of her body. My father had picked up a thin rod like a knitting needle. \u201cNow. This is the hard part,\u201d he said. He spoke in a conversational tone, milder I think than any I have ever heard from him. \u201cAnd the more you tighten up the harder it will be. So just\u2014easy. There. Easy. Good girl. Good girl.\u201d I was trying to think of something to say that would ease her or distract her. I could see now what my father was doing. Laid out on a white cloth on the table beside him he had a series of rods, all of the same length but of a graduated thickness. These were what he would use, one after the other, to open and stretch the cervix. From my station behind the sheeted barrier beyond the girl\u2019s knees, I could not see the actual, intimate progress of these instruments. But I could feel it, from the arriving waves of pain in her body that beat down the spasms of apprehension and actually made her quieter. Where are you from? Where did you go to school? Do you have a job? (I had noticed a wedding ring, but quite possibly they all wore wedding rings.) Do you have any brothers or sisters? Why should she want to answer any of that, even if she weren\u2019t in pain? She sucked her breath back through her teeth and widened her eyes at the ceiling. \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cGetting there,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl. Good quiet girl. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d I said, \u201cI was going to paint this room, but I never got around to it. If you were going to paint it, what color would you choose?\u201d \u201cHoh,\u201d said Madeleine. \u201cHoh.\u201d A sudden startled expulsion of breath. \u201cHoh. Hoh.\u201d \u201cYellow?\u201d I said. \u201cI thought a light yellow. Or a light green?\u201d By the time we got to the thickest rod Madeleine had thrust her head back into the flat cushion, stretching out her long neck, and stretching her mouth, too, lips wide and tight over her teeth. \u201cThink of your favorite movie. What is your favorite movie?\u201d A nurse said that to me, just as I reached the unbelievable interminable plateau of pain and was convinced that relief would not come, not this time. How could movies exist anymore in the world? Now I\u2019d said the same thing to Madeleine and Madeleine\u2019s eyes flicked over me with the coldly distracted expression of someone who sees that a human being can be about as much use as a stopped clock. I risked taking one hand off her knee and touched her han",
    "paragraph2": "As I stood in my father's office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation as he asked for my assistance with a procedure. His usual assistant, Mrs. Barrie, was still recovering from an injury and was unavailable to help, so I had been called in as a last-minute replacement. I had watched my father perform countless medical procedures over the years, but I had never actually participated in one before. My father, a seasoned doctor with years of experience, seemed to sense my hesitation and gave me a reassuring nod as he began to explain the procedure. We were going to be performing a dilation and curettage, a relatively routine procedure, but one that still made me feel a bit uneasy. The patient, a young woman named Madeleine, was already lying on the examination table, her eyes fixed on the ceiling as she tried to calm her racing heart. My father handed me a pair of gloves and instructed me to hold Madeleine's knees steady, which I did, trying to offer her a reassuring smile as I did so.As the procedure began, I couldn't help but notice the look of distress on Madeleine's face. She was shivering and clenching her teeth, her eyes welling up with tears as my father worked. I tried to distract her with conversation, asking her about her interests and hobbies, but she was too caught up in her own pain and discomfort to respond. My father worked quickly and efficiently, his hands moving with a precision that came from years of practice, but even he couldn't hide the look of weariness that had been etched on his face for weeks. It had been a long and difficult few months, with Mrs. Barrie's injury and a heavier-than-usual patient load taking its toll on him. I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt as I watched him work, knowing that I was planning to leave soon, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, and wondering who would be there to help him when I was gone.Despite the difficulties of the procedure, my father worked tirelessly, his focus solely on Madeleine and her well-being. I watched in awe as he expertly navigated the complexities of the human body, his hands moving with a gentle precision that belied the difficulty of the task at hand. As the procedure drew to a close, Madeleine's distress began to subside, replaced by a look of relief and exhaustion. My father smiled wearily and patted her hand, offering her words of comfort and reassurance as he helped her sit up and begin the slow process of recovery. As I watched, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for my father, who had dedicated his life to helping others, often at great personal cost.As the procedure came to an end and Madeleine was helped off the examination table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. It had been a difficult and trying experience, but we had gotten through it, and Madeleine was on the road to recovery. My father smiled wearily and thanked me for my help, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he did so. I smiled back, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment at having been able to assist him, even if it was just in a small way. As we cleaned up the examination room and prepared for the next patient, I couldn't help but think about the future, and the possibilities that lay ahead. I had always known that I wanted to leave, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, but now I wasn't so sure. My father needed me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was abandoning him by leaving.",

Henry insisted on practicing yoga with Ellie in the evenings, as well, and he trusted her meticulous approach to packing and logistics more.

Uncle Jerry, with his forced smiles and awkward attempts at conversation over breakfast, seemed to be trying too hard to bridge a gap that felt more like a chasm to Louisa, his questions about her school preferences and favorite foods landing like pebbles tossed into a deep well, echoing but never quite reaching the bottom.

Residents stopped trusting one another, avoiding eye contact and skipping town meetings. The main road, once busy with cars heading to the city, became a sparse, cracked stretch. Fewer vehicles meant fewer supplies, and the corner store shelves grew barer each week. Instead of waiting for deliveries which never came, the residents turned toward self-sufficiency. Families gathered to jar whatever produce they could salvage from late harvests, reinforce rotting window frames, and sort through old woolens. The town was enveloped in the sweetness of wood smoke and the distant promise of snow. As autumn winds crept into town, conversations featured only the coming cold; the residents worked side by side, often wordlessly. The stories that had pervaded every household now left residual silence, haunted by uncertainty.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "As I sit here, surrounded by the quiet chaos of my home, I'm reminded of the intricate web of relationships that has become my life. My partner, Connie, is pregnant, and I couldn't be more thrilled - or so I thought, until our neighbor, Allison, announced she was also expecting. The irony isn't lost on Connie, who finds the situation endlessly amusing, often making lighthearted comments about Allison's growing belly, completely unaware of the complicated history between us. I try to laugh along with her, but it's a forced smile, a desperate attempt to conceal the turmoil brewing inside me. You see, I've known Allison for a while, and our relationship has always been... complicated. When she first told me she was considering having a child, I tried to dissuade her, citing all the reasons why it wasn't the right time, but she was resolute. She had her reasons, personal and deeply rooted, and I couldn't sway her, no matter how hard I tried. Now, as I watch her waddle around her yard, a constant reminder of my own impending fatherhood, I'm forced to confront the consequences of my actions. It's days like today, when I'm working from home, that I get lost in my thoughts. I spent the morning deeply engrossed in my work, the hours ticking by in a blur, until my bladder finally protested, forcing me to take a break. As I stood in the bathroom, staring blankly out the window, I noticed a commotion on my lawn - the Cherry Pit, a rambunctious little dog with a penchant for trouble, was causing a scene. My heart sank as I watched it dig up the grass, its antics transporting me back to the events that led us to this point. It was the Cherry Pit, after all, that had brought Allison and me together, our shared concern for its well-being sparking a connection that would eventually lead to... well, to this. I sighed, feeling the weight of my secrets bearing down on me, and wondered how I'd managed to get myself into this mess. As I stood there, frozen in thought, the Cherry Pit looked up, its big brown eyes meeting mine, and for a moment, I felt like it was the only one who truly understood the complexity of my situation.",
    "paragraph2": "Fast-forward seven and a half months. I am living in a house with a pregnant woman next door to a house in which there is another pregnant woman. Connie seems to find this amusing, never suspecting the truth of the matter. We\u2019ll glance up from the porch and see Allison emerging heavily from her car with an armload of groceries, and Connie will say things like \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t have to pee every five minutes the way I do\u201d and \u201cShe won\u2019t say who the father is\u2014I just hope it\u2019s not that a-hole from Animal Control, what was his name?\u201d This is problematic on a number of levels.

If you want to know the truth, she\u2019s lower-class, Roy, and I\u2019m sorry to have to say it\u2014\u201d I\u2019m not about to argue the point. The fact is I tried everything I could to talk Allison out of going through with this\u2014finally, to my shame, falling back on the same argument about the whole \u00dcbermensch-Untermensch dynamic that Connie used on me\u2014but Allison merely gave me a bitter smile and said, \u201cI trust your genes, Roy.

My partner, Connie, is pregnant, and I couldn't be more thrilled - or so I thought, until our neighbor, Allison, announced she was also expecting. The irony isn't lost on Connie, who finds the situation endlessly amusing, often making lighthearted comments about Allison's growing belly, completely unaware of the complicated history between us. I try to laugh along with her, but it's a forced smile, a desperate attempt to conceal the turmoil brewing inside me. You see, I've known Allison for a while, and our relationship has always been... complicated. When she first told me she was considering having a child, I tried to dissuade her, citing all the reasons why it wasn't the right time, but she was resolute. She had her reasons, personal and deeply rooted, and I couldn't sway her, no matter how hard I tried. Now, as I watch her waddle around her yard, a constant reminder of my own impending fatherhood, I'm forced to confront the consequences of my actions. It's days like today, when I'm working from home, that I get lost in my thoughts. I spent the morning deeply engrossed in my work, the hours ticking by in a blur, until my bladder finally protested, forcing me to take a break. As I stood in the bathroom, staring blankly out the window, I noticed a commotion on my lawn - the Cherry Pit, a rambunctious little dog with a penchant for trouble, was causing a scene. My heart sank as I watched it dig up the grass, its antics transporting me back to the events that led us to this point. It was the Cherry Pit, after all, that had brought Allison and me together, our shared concern for its well-being sparking a connection that would eventually lead to... well, to this. I sighed, feeling the weight of my secrets bearing down on me, and wondered how I'd managed to get myself into this mess. As I stood there, frozen in thought, the Cherry Pit looked up, its big brown eyes meeting mine, and for a moment, I felt like it was the only one who truly understood the complexity of my situation.\n\nParagraph 2:\nFast-forward seven and a half months. I am living in a house with a pregnant woman next door to a house in which there is another pregnant woman. Connie seems to find this amusing, never suspecting the truth of the matter. We\u2019ll glance up from the porch and see Allison emerging heavily from her car with an armload of groceries, and Connie will say things like \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t have to pee every five minutes the way I do\u201d and \u201cShe won\u2019t say who the father is\u2014I just hope it\u2019s not that a-hole from Animal Control, what was his name?\u201d This is problematic on a number of levels. I play dumb, of course\u2014what else can I do? \u201cMaybe she went to GenLab,\u201d I say. \u201cHer? You\u2019re kidding me, right? I mean, look at that string of jerks she keeps dating. If you want to know the truth, she\u2019s lower-class, Roy, and I\u2019m sorry to have to say it\u2014\u201d I\u2019m not about to argue the point. The fact is I tried everything I could to talk Allison out of going through with this\u2014finally, to my shame, falling back on the same argument about the whole \u00dcbermensch-Untermensch dynamic that Connie used on me\u2014but Allison merely gave me a bitter smile and said, \u201cI trust your genes, Roy. You don\u2019t have to be involved. I just want to do this, that\u2019s all. For myself. And for nature. You believe in nature, don\u2019t you?\u201d You don\u2019t have to be involved.

By then Mami was starting to flip seriously out. Had the Four Horsefaces putting out an A.P.B. on the godline. Walked around the neighborhood asking everybody if they\u2019d seen my brother, even the gringos, and my mother had to be under serious duress to speak to a gringo. I was starting to worry, too, remembering that when he was first diagnosed he\u2019d jumped into his ride and tried to drive to Miami, where he had some boy or another. He hadn\u2019t made it past Philly before his car broke down. I wondered if he was on his way to Cali or something. He\u2019d always wanted to see L.A. One of his dreams. I got worried enough that I walked over to Tammy Franco\u2019s house, but when her Polack husband answered the door I lost my nerve. I turned around and walked away. On the third night we were in the apartment just waiting when the Monarch pulled up. My mother ran over to the porch. Holding the curtains until her knuckles were white. No, she said finally. Rafa stomped in with Pura in tow. He was clearly drunk, and Pura was dressed as if they\u2019d just been at a club. Where have you been? Mami said. Check it out, Rafa said, holding out both his and Pura\u2019s hands. They had rings on. We got married! It\u2019s totally official, Pura said giddily, pulling the license from her purse. You should have seen the expression on my mother\u2019s face. It was worse than when my father ran off with his putika. Worse than when the doctor had first said the word \u201cleukemia.\u201d Her face drained of everything. Is she pregnant? Not yet, Pura said. Is she pregnant? My mother looked straight at my brother. No, Rafa said. I\u2019m going to be moving in, cu\u00f1ada. Pura went to hug my mother. Let\u2019s have a drink, my brother said. My mother stopped Pura with an upraised finger. No one is drinking in my house. I\u2019m having a drink. My brother walked toward the kitchen but my mother stiff-armed him. Ma, Rafa said. No one is drinking in this house. She pushed Rafa back.

For a second I thought my brother, who had punched every fucking thing that had ever crossed him\u2014boys, girls, men, women, viejos, white boys, morenos, Boricuas, Filipinos, chinos, teachers, policemen\u2014but had never in his life put his hand on my mother, was going to pop her.

When he walked through the door with Pura by his side, something in Mami's eyes changed \u2013 a mixture of relief instantly morphing into confusion, then anger. \"We got married,\" Rafa announced, his voice carrying a defiant pride that made my stomach twist. Mami's face drained of color as she processed the news, her hands gripping the kitchen counter so hard her knuckles turned white. I stood in the corner, watching the scene unfold like a witness to an inevitable crash. \"\u00bfEst\u00e1s loco?\" Mami's voice trembled, barely above a whisper at first, then rising like a storm. \"How could you do this? With your condition? Without telling me?\" Rafa's health had always been a source of worry for all of us, but he hated being reminded of it, and I could see his jaw tightening at Mami's words. Pura stood slightly behind him, her face a mask of discomfort and determination. The argument escalated quickly, with Mami's words becoming sharper, more cutting, as she demanded they leave her house immediately. \"You want to play husband? Then go be a man and provide for your wife somewhere else!\" she shouted, her accent thickening with emotion. Rafa started to argue back, his voice matching her intensity, but there was a hint of desperation in it that I hadn't heard before.

Finally, after what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes, Rafa grabbed Pura's hand and headed for the door. He paused briefly, looking back at Mami with a mixture of hurt and anger that made him seem both older and younger than his years. \"V\u00e1monos,\" he said to Pura, his voice now eerily calm.

I stood there, torn between following my brother and comforting my mother, feeling the weight of family loyalty pulling me in opposite directions.

Took the Monarch and vanished. No note or telephone call, nada. Gone for one day, gone for two. By then Mami was starting to flip seriously out. Had the Four Horsefaces putting out an A.P.B. on the godline. Walked around the neighborhood asking everybody if they\u2019d seen my brother, even the gringos, and my mother had to be under serious duress to speak to a gringo. I was starting to worry, too, remembering that when he was first diagnosed he\u2019d jumped into his ride and tried to drive to Miami, where he had some boy or another. He hadn\u2019t made it past Philly before his car broke down. I wondered if he was on his way to Cali or something. He\u2019d always wanted to see L.A. One of his dreams. I got worried enough that I walked over to Tammy Franco\u2019s house, but when her Polack husband answered the door I lost my nerve. I turned around and walked away. On the third night we were in the apartment just waiting when the Monarch pulled up. My mother ran over to the porch. Holding the curtains until her knuckles were white. No, she said finally. Rafa stomped in with Pura in tow. He was clearly drunk, and Pura was dressed as if they\u2019d just been at a club. Where have you been? Mami said. Check it out, Rafa said, holding out both his and Pura\u2019s hands. They had rings on. We got married! It\u2019s totally official, Pura said giddily, pulling the license from her purse. You should have seen the expression on my mother\u2019s face. It was worse than when my father ran off with his putika. Worse than when the doctor had first said the word \u201cleukemia.\u201d Her face drained of everything. Is she pregnant? Not yet, Pura said. Is she pregnant? My mother looked straight at my brother. No, Rafa said. I\u2019m going to be moving in, cu\u00f1ada. Pura went to hug my mother. Let\u2019s have a drink, my brother said. My mother stopped Pura with an upraised finger. No one is drinking in my house. I\u2019m having a drink. My brother walked toward the kitchen but my mother stiff-armed him. Ma, Rafa said. No one is drinking in this house. She pushed Rafa back. If this\u2014she threw her hand in Pura\u2019s direction\u2014is how you want to spend what might be the last months of your life, then, Rafael Urbano, I have nothing more to say to you. Please, I would like you and your puta to leave my house. My brother\u2019s eyes went flat. I ain\u2019t going anywhere. I want you\u2014and this is when she started shrieking\u2014out of here! For a second I thought my brother, who had punched every fucking thing that had ever crossed him\u2014boys, girls, men, women, viejos, white boys, morenos, Boricuas, Filipinos, chinos, teachers, policemen\u2014but had never in his life put his hand on my mother, was going to pop her. I really did. And for an instant I think he considered it. But then all the swolt went out of him. He put his arm around Pura (who, for once, looked as if she understood that something was wrong).

    "paragraph1": "And then, miraculously, I made the acquaintance of R\u00e9gine. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d \u201cBy chance and persistence, which is to say that the tenacity I devoted not to finding you, exactly, since I had no idea you existed, but to following the trail of the good Denis led me to you, by accident, by fortune.\u201d \u201cYes, Denis. Why do you call him the good Denis?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how people speak of him to me. Is it not true?\u201d \u201cOh, it is, it is. Oh, yes, yes. The too good Denis, if you see what I mean, the excessively good Denis, perhaps, but, yes, he was good, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d \u201cOh, I am, I am. His goodness was like a thunderbolt, you see. No, I\u2019m wrong, his goodness was like the slow fire that descends from the heavens and settles over your soul and convinces you, numbs you, makes you feel you\u2019re nothing much but gives you hope that with meditation, integrity, and honor you may eventually become blessed yourself. You see, Denis, without knowing it or wanting it, was truly a saint. Like any saint, I suppose, he could be fearsome and terrifying in his greatness, that greatness of which he was unaware. Implacably rigorous in pursuing a goodness he clearly didn\u2019t register. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d \u201cMe? But, you understand, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d \u201cYou did, though, even if you were too young to remember. And what matters in all this is that he knew you well, he raised you, he cared for you like his own daughter, and he loved you the same way, happily, passionately. It was because of you that he refused to have a child with me, out of a monstrously virtuous fidelity to his memory of that tiny girl, you. \u2018I can\u2019t let another child into my memory,\u2019 he would tell me. \u2018I can\u2019t think of creating any competition between my memory of Mimi and the memory I might have of another little girl.\u2019 And I answered, \u2018But what makes you think you\u2019d lose our child, too?\u2019 And he said, \u2018It happens. I owe it to Mimi to forever think of her as the only child I ever loved.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not dead!\u201d \u201cHe lost you\u2014it\u2019s the same thing. As I understand it, your mother took you away one day, left him just like that, and of course you went with her. Denis\u2019s glorious simplicity shielded him from hard feelings, and even from pointless anguish, from vainly protracted grief. He endured his lot with a smile. And, at the same time, he resolved to remain forever the father of only one child, you. Oh, not, as you must already understand, to spare himself other sorrows. He never gave that a thought. He had no fear of sorrow, and he didn\u2019t wallow in it. It\u2019s just that the inexorable, unyielding nature of his marvellous humanity had led him to decide that because he\u2019d loved you desperately, and because you\u2019d been taken away from him without your wanting it at all, he owed it to you never to attach himself to any other child, ever.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! It\u2019s absurd!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. That was Denis. That was why I left him. I went on to have the children I wanted, of course, with other men. But I miss the child Denis and I would have had, so I can\u2019t help resenting you a little. Forgive me, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The strange damage that goodness can do! When I asked R\u00e9gine how she felt about my wish to meet in person, she seemed surprised and shocked, as if I were proposing something utterly immoral. \u201cWhat reason would I have for meeting you? The adult that you are has no place in my life, you don\u2019t interest me. And also I want to forget the good Denis\u2014I\u2019ve been working on that all this time. Meet you? Who do you think you are? How indecent! You do not interest me, Madame. To me, Madame, you are only the faded reflection of a child who caused my unhappiness. I couldn\u2019t hate the little girl Denis so loved that he couldn\u2019t imagine giving the smallest share of his unlimited tenderness to any other, even his own\u2014I couldn\u2019t hate her, because you can\u2019t hate a child. But the woman you\u2019ve become I can only resent, however unfair that may be.\u201d Although it was hard, I decided not to ask for R\u00e9gine\u2019s forgiveness. I asked only if she knew where the good Denis lived. \u201cI do not, and I have no wish to. I\u2019m not good. I haven\u2019t entirely freed myself from anger and acrimony, brooding and pointless self-pity. I\u2019m quite sure that Denis, in his radiant, indifferent goodness, never broods. Happy are the blessed! Does he remember me? Or has he, for my own good, erased me from his memory? If you meet him, tell him about me, I\u2019m begging you, mention R\u00e9gine. . . .\u201d I wasn\u2019t good, either. If ever I did have the chance to meet Denis, I would certainly not speak the name of this R\u00e9gine, who had, there\u2019s no other word for it, cursed me. I wasn\u2019t good, either. I tried not to be proud of that. I would have been ashamed of my pride, but still proud.",
    "paragraph2": "I first learned about R\u00e9gine through a series of peculiar circumstances that revolved around Denis, whom everyone referred to as \"the good Denis,\" and this encounter would ultimately reveal a complex web of emotions and unspoken histories that I never could have anticipated. The story unfolded gradually, with R\u00e9gine eventually sharing the profound impact Denis had on her life, but what she revealed next shook me to my core \u2013 Denis had harbored an intense, almost sacred love for me when I was a child, so much so that it had prevented him from having children with her, a fact that had caused her immense pain and resentment over the years. As she recounted her story, I could feel the weight of her words, heavy with years of suppressed emotions and unfulfilled dreams, all somehow connected to my unknowing presence in Denis's life. Her revelation was both touching and disturbing, painting a picture of Denis as a man whose capacity for love had somehow become fixated on a child \u2013 me \u2013 to the detriment of his adult relationships, particularly his relationship with R\u00e9gine. The complexity of her feelings was evident in how she spoke about Denis, mixing reverence for his saintly nature with the bitter acknowledgment of how his devotion to me had ultimately led to her own unhappiness. When I expressed a desire to meet her in person, perhaps hoping to bridge this unexpected gap between us or offer some form of reconciliation, she firmly rejected the idea, making it clear that she preferred to forget both Denis and her resentment towards me as an adult. Her rejection forced me to confront my own role in this complicated narrative, though I had been merely a child and unaware of the impact my presence had on their lives. As I reflected on this situation, I became acutely aware of my own lack of goodness, particularly in comparison to Denis's apparent saintliness, and I made the conscious decision not to seek R\u00e9gine's forgiveness, understanding that some wounds are better left untouched. This experience left me with a peculiar resolution: if I ever were to encounter Denis again, I would keep my knowledge of R\u00e9gine and her story buried deep within me, maintaining the silence that she so desperately sought. The whole situation had revealed layers of human complexity I hadn't expected to encounter \u2013 how one person's pure love could inadvertently cause another's suffering, how childhood innocence could unknowingly cast long shadows into adult lives, and how the past continues to shape our present in ways we can never fully understand. The story of R\u00e9gine, Denis, and my unwitting role in their narrative became a testament to the intricate ways in which human lives intersect and affect one another, often without our knowledge or consent, and how some relationships, despite their significance, are better left in the realm of memory rather than pursued into the present. This realization came with a certain melancholy, an understanding that sometimes the kindest action is to respect the distances that others choose to maintain, even when those distances are born from pain and resentment that we didn't intentionally cause. The entire experience left me with a profound appreciation for the complexity of human relationships and the way that love, even in its purest form, can sometimes lead to unexpected consequences that ripple through time, affecting lives in ways we could never predict or fully comprehend. The situation with R\u00e9gine and Denis had become a lesson in the delicate balance between understanding and action, between the desire to make amends and the wisdom to know when to step back, and ultimately, about the complicated nature of human",

We scrabbled through doors and rooms, and when we got to the library a voice said, \u201cCome in, come in,\u201d as if it had been expecting us. The voice belonged to a man of perhaps seventy-one, who was sitting low behind a desk, sipping from a snifter of what looked like corrupted urine and talking on a phone that for an instant I took to be a large kitten.

Your wife\u2019s family? So we\u2019re thinking sort of a John Nash in \u2018The Good Shepherd\u2019 thing, but without all the schizophrenia, of course, and David\u2019s got this big fucking man-crush on Louis Malle, so we\u2019re doing kind of an \u2018Au Revoir les Enfants\u2019 open, very faithful to the spirit of Hirschman\u2019s story, you know, but\u2014\u201d Wagner held up a hand as though in some vague pain. \u201cYeah, yeah, I get it. I talked to David. Look, I\u2019m on board. I don\u2019t give a fuck about Hirschman, but my wife, Lydia, she won\u2019t shut up about \u2018Nana would have wanted to see her Albie as Zac Efron\u2019 or whatever. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous, but you get to the point of certain understandings\u201d\u2014Wagner inclined his head toward the half-dressed woman in the corner\u2014\u201cand, well, you get the picture.\u201d He put his hands on the desk and raised himself, and he must have been sitting in a comically small chair, because when he stood, far from being the wizened troll I had come to imagine, he loomed over both of us, six-four easy, with an elegant and gawky grace. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201cgive me some of that blow you\u2019re on and I\u2019ll let you in on a secret.\u201d Eli reached into his pocket without taking his eyes off Wagner and passed him the bag. The man looked at us like we had to be joking but then produced a two-inch piece of straw from the breast pocket of his jacket and snorted everything that was left, right from the plastic. He thumbed his nose and sniffed a few times, then gave a small shrug of disdain and settled, half sitting, on the front of the desk. \u201cThat coke sucks, but I\u2019ll tell you, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I was going to say: Stop giving so much of a shit.\u201d We blinked at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said. I love that you can ask people what they mean right after they\u2019ve said the most obvious things and almost invariably they\u2019ll assume that they are the ones who\u2019ve failed to be clear and go to elaborate lengths to make themselves understood. Wagner looked at me, then turned to Eli. \u201cYour friend\u2019s retarded,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I mean is\u2014look, if you care about something, like horses, go raise horses. Go ride them and fuck them or whatever people do with horses. Sell them to Arabs, I\u2019d guess. But if you\u2019re going to stay in this crappy business, and they\u2019re all crappy, stop giving a shit. Because you\u2019re here for one reason and you should know what that reason is. Do you?\u201d He looked from one of us to the other, then barked \u201cSonia!,\u201d and we jumped, but Sonia didn\u2019t. She just walked over and spanked us both insanely hard on the ass with her riding crop. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re here,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cis that you already have nice cars\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t, but I went along with the spirit of his admonition\u2014\u201cand girlfriends with that taut skin, and nice rentals in the hills\u2014or maybe you own?\u201d He looked at us doubtfully. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have the good stuff, do you, the really hard-to-come-by shit. You know what I\u2019m talking about: Envy. Serious, irrefutable reasons for people to envy you. And not just any sort of people, of course. You need people well informed enough to understand just how enviable you are. And people clever enough to know how to show their envy without being sycophants, and worldly enough to be charming company while they\u2019re envying you. . . . You need courtiers, see? Oh, they\u2019re better and worse than friends. They don\u2019t care about you, sure, but they understand the terms of your success far better than a friend ever could.

    "paragraph2": "As I followed Eli through the musty aisles of the library, the scent of old books and stale air filled my nostrils, and the soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead seemed to reverberate through my entire being. We had been working on our film project for months, and Eli, ever the networker, had insisted that we needed to get out and meet people, make connections, and get our names out there. I had reluctantly agreed, and so here we were, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispering patrons, on the hunt for someone, anyone, who might be able to help us break into the industry. That's when we saw him - Wagner, an older man with a commanding presence, sipping a drink from a flask and talking on his phone in hushed tones. He was a striking figure, with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy beard to match, and his eyes seemed to gleam with a knowing intensity that made me feel like an insect under a microscope. Nearby, an Amazonian woman with long, curly hair and a bright smile stood watching him, her eyes never leaving his face. Eli, undaunted by Wagner's formidable appearance, strode right up to him and introduced himself, explaining our film project and asking if he might be willing to offer some advice. At first, Wagner was dismissive, barely looking up from his phone as he muttered a few curt words, but Eli persisted, and eventually, Wagner's demeanor softened, and he began to engage with us. As we talked, I found myself drawn into Wagner's orbit, captivated by his world-weary cynicism and the way he seemed to see right through the fa\u00e7ade of the industry we were trying to break into. \"Don't care too much,\" he told us, his voice dripping with disdain. \"That's the secret to success. Don't get too attached, don't get too invested. Because the minute you do, someone will come along and rip it all away from you.\" Eli and I exchanged a skeptical glance, but Wagner just chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound, and continued, \"You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen it happen to the best of them. You want to make it in this business? Learn to not care.\" As he spoke, Sonia, the Amazonian woman, watched him with an intensity that bordered on devotion, and I found myself wondering what her story was, how she had ended up in Wagner's orbit. Wagner, seeming to sense my curiosity, smiled wryly and said, \"Sonia here knows all about pain. Real pain, not the fake stuff they peddle in the movies. She's been through hell and back, and she's still standing.\" Sonia's eyes never left Wagner's face, but I could sense a flicker of emotion behind them, a deep well of feeling that seemed to underscore Wagner's words. Eventually, Eli and I bid Wagner farewell, thanking him for his time and advice, and made our way out of the library, into the bright, cold sunlight. The encounter had left me feeling unsettled, unsure of what to make of Wagner's jaded perspective, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were just pawns in a much larger game. Later that night, at a New Year's Eve party, I found myself lost in thought, replaying the conversation with Wagner in my head. I had also been thinking about a conversation I had with Lily, a friend from college, about the futility of pursuing a romantic relationship. She had been going through a tough breakup, and I had",

This air of mystery surrounding her was precisely what drew Harouni in, a man with a history of romantic entanglements with the maidservants who worked for his family. His fascination with Husna was evident, and she, in turn, seemed to revel in the attention, skillfully manipulating the dynamics of their interactions to her advantage. It was six weeks after her initial walk with K.K. that Begum Harouni announced her plans to embark on a pilgrimage, an event that would temporarily upend the household's routine. Husna seized this opportunity to engage Harouni in conversation, discussing the begum's impending departure with a mixture of curiosity and concern. As they spoke, Husna busied herself making Harouni's tea, her small hands moving deftly as she worked. She joked about her inability to type, a lighthearted remark that caught Harouni off guard and led to a moment of shared amusement between them. Despite the begum's absence, Husna expressed worry about not being able to visit the household, but K.K. was quick to reassure her, insisting that she was welcome to visit even more frequently. This exchange was telling, revealing the extent to which Husna had insinuated herself into the household's rhythms and relationships. Rafik and Shah Sahib, too, were drawn into her orbit, their interactions with her characterized by a sense of warmth and familiarity. As the days passed, it became increasingly clear that Husna's presence was having a profound impact on the household, one that would only continue to grow in her influence. And yet, despite her charm and charisma, Husna remained an enigma, a woman whose true nature and intentions were impossible to fully discern.",

As a boy, Harouni had slept with maidservants, lost his virginity to one of them at fourteen. Husna evoked those ripe first encounters. Six weeks after Husna\u2019s initial walk with K.K., Begum Harouni announced a pilgrimage to the Holy Places, in order to perform the umrah. Husna decided to bring the begum\u2019s impending departure into the conversation with Harouni that afternoon, before any guests arrived and interrupted them. When Rafik brought afternoon tea into the living room, K.K. could hear the typewriter clacking in the background. It stopped, and then Husna knocked. She opened the door, showing her head without entering. \u201cCome in, my dear.\u201d Husna\u2019s cultivation of Rafik had progressed to the point where he included an extra cup on the tea trolley. She drew herself forward and made K.K.\u2019s tea exactly as he liked it. A boy passed a plate of biscuits, while Rafik stood back on his heels by the door. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here,\u201d Husna said, \u201ceverything is so nice and everyone is pleasant. These biscuits, the tea.

But then all of me is small.\u201d She wore a tight kurta, showing the cleft of her breasts, which jutted out from her muscular youthful torso. Their eyes met; they both saw the joke, and he allowed himself a tight-lipped smile, his composed expression becoming avid and boyish. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling you about,\u201d Husna purred, putting her hand on his arm. \u201cYour crocodile smile, the one I like.\u201d After pausing for a moment, she lowered her eyes and said in a meek voice, \u201cBut soon I won\u2019t be able to come here. The begum is going on umrah, so I\u2019ll have to be in charge of her house.\u201d \u201cNot umrah again!\u201d K.K. said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a vice with her.

Husna seized this opportunity to engage Harouni in conversation, discussing the begum's impending departure with a mixture of curiosity and concern. As they spoke, Husna busied herself making Harouni's tea, her small hands moving deftly as she worked. She joked about her inability to type, a lighthearted remark that caught Harouni off guard and led to a moment of shared amusement between them. Despite the begum's absence, Husna expressed worry about not being able to visit the household, but K.K. was quick to reassure her, insisting that she was welcome to visit even more frequently. This exchange was telling, revealing the extent to which Husna had insinuated herself into the household's rhythms and relationships. Rafik and Shah Sahib, too, were drawn into her orbit, their interactions with her characterized by a sense of warmth and familiarity. As the days passed, it became increasingly clear that Husna's presence was having a profound impact on the household, one that would only continue to grow in her influence. And yet, despite her charm and charisma, Husna remained an enigma, a woman whose true nature and intentions were impossible to fully discern.\n\nParagraph 2:\nShe did not behave or speak in the way of the women he normally met, for she had always inhabited an indefinite space, neither rich nor poor, neither servant nor begum, in a city where the very concept of a middle class still found expression in only a few households, among managers of banks and of big industrial concerns\u2014sugar and textiles and steel. As a boy, Harouni had slept with maidservants, lost his virginity to one of them at fourteen. Husna evoked those ripe first encounters. Six weeks after Husna\u2019s initial walk with K.K., Begum Harouni announced a pilgrimage to the Holy Places, in order to perform the umrah. Husna decided to bring the begum\u2019s impending departure into the conversation with Harouni that afternoon, before any guests arrived and interrupted them. When Rafik brought afternoon tea into the living room, K.K. could hear the typewriter clacking in the background. It stopped, and then Husna knocked. She opened the door, showing her head without entering. \u201cCome in, my dear.\u201d Husna\u2019s cultivation of Rafik had progressed to the point where he included an extra cup on the tea trolley. She drew herself forward and made K.K.\u2019s tea exactly as he liked it. A boy passed a plate of biscuits, while Rafik stood back on his heels by the door. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here,\u201d Husna said, \u201ceverything is so nice and everyone is pleasant. These biscuits, the tea. Shah Sahib tries so hard to teach me the typing, though I can\u2019t seem to learn.\u201d She held out her hands and spread her fingers in front of him, like a cat stretching. \u201cMy hands are so tiny, I can\u2019t reach the keys. But then all of me is small.\u201d She wore a tight kurta, showing the cleft of her breasts, which jutted out from her muscular youthful torso. Their eyes met; they both saw the joke, and he allowed himself a tight-lipped smile, his composed expression becoming avid and boyish. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling you about,\u201d Husna purred, putting her hand on his arm. \u201cYour crocodile smile, the one I like.\u201d After pausing for a moment, she lowered her eyes and said in a meek voice, \u201cBut soon I won\u2019t be able to come here. The begum is going on umrah, so I\u2019ll have to be in charge of her house.\u201d \u201cNot umrah again!\u201d K.K. said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a vice with her. But, darling, don\u2019t be ridiculous. If she\u2019s away, you can come even more regularly.\u201d\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It was then that he noticed the small, gleaming key nestled in her trembling hand. A bolt of fear shot through him, and he rushed to his study, his heart pounding in his chest. The envelope was missing, confirming his worst fears. The letters from Qingqing, secrets he had hoped to keep hidden, were now exposed. He returned to Lin Hong, his anger mingled with desperation, and confronted her about the discovery. Her trembling increased, and when he reached out to touch her shoulder, she flinched, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. The emotional turmoil was etched on her face, a mirror to the guilt and distress that gnawed at him. Li Hanlin's facade of anger crumbled, revealing the vulnerability beneath. In that silent exchange, amidst the charged atmosphere of unspoken words and raw emotions, both grappled with the unraveling of trust, unsure of what lay ahead for their fractured relationship.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It was as if the collective psyche of Willowdale had been incrementally desensitized, normalizing the absurdity of having raccoons dictate the rhythm of daily life. The once-quaint town was now a surreal landscape, where humans tiptoed around raccoons, and the line between nuisance and norm had been irreparably blurred.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn the small town of Willowdale, a peculiar phenomenon began to unfold. It all started with a lone, mischievous raccoon named Rascal, who would occasionally knock over a trash can or two on Main Street during his scavenging antics. At first, the townsfolk were amused by the raccoon, chuckling and quickly cleaning up after his mess. However, Rascal's pranks became more frequent and brazen, with him eventually stealing food from market stalls and leaving a trail of destruction in his wake. Despite the growing chaos, the townsfolk continued to downplay the issue, remaining somewhat enthralled by Rascal's \"mischievous charm\" and quietly grateful for the distraction from the usual quiet. As time passed, however, more raccoons joined Rascal's ranks, and soon the town was overrun with marauding bands of masked bandits. Shopkeepers began to leave out offerings of food, hoping to appease the raccoons and avoid trouble. Eventually, this tactic gained traction amongst the townsfolk, and Rascal's gang became accepted, if not celebrated, as the town's beloved mascots. It was almost as though the entire town of Willowdale had gradually been inoculated to the presence of the raccoons regardless of the absurd situation. The once-quiet town was now a quaint landscape, where humans tiptoed around raccoons, and the line between nuisance and norm had been irreparably blurred.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "Carla had always harbored a dismissive view of mobile homes, an outlook she inherited from her parents, who saw them as inferior and temporary. However, this perspective began to evolve after she moved in with Clark. Initially, she was hesitant about the change, but as she settled into the community, she was struck by the individuality and creativity that many people expressed through their mobile homes. Each trailer seemed to tell a story, reflecting the unique tastes and personalities of its occupants. Inspired by the ingenuity around her, Carla grew eager to infuse her own sense of style into her living space. Clark, ever supportive in the beginning, eagerly participated in her plans, starting with building new steps and investing in materials for various renovations. Yet, when it came to replacing the carpet, Clark's enthusiasm waned. The carpet, with its dated and unattractive pattern, became a point of contention. Carla found it particularly unappealing, and during times when Clark's mood became oppressive, she often found herself fixating on the carpet's intricate design as a distraction. It was during these moments that the indoor environment felt stifling, pushing Carla to seek refuge in the barn. The barn became her sanctuary, a place where the horses, indifferent to human emotions, offered a form of escape through their simple, routine presence. However, it was Flora, with her playful and understanding gaze, who provided Carla with a semblance of companionship. Flora's empathetic presence was a balm to Carla's unease; the animal seemed to sense when Carla needed comfort, offering it through gentle nudges and soft whinnies. This connection with Flora became a vital part of Carla's life, a reminder that even in moments of discontent, there was a space where she felt understood and accepted. As Carla continued to navigate her mixed feelings about the mobile home and her relationship with Clark, she realized that her journey was not just about transforming a living space but also about redefining her own perspectives and finding solace in unexpected places.",
    "paragraph2": "Up until three years ago, Carla had never really looked at mobile homes. She hadn\u2019t called them that, either. Like her parents, she would have thought the term \u201cmobile home\u201d pretentious. Some people lived in trailers, and that was all there was to it. One trailer was no different from another. When she moved in here, when she chose this life with Clark, she began to see things in a new way. After that, it was only the mobile homes that she really looked at, to see how people had fixed them up\u2014the kind of curtains they had hung, the way they had painted the trim, the ambitious decks or patios or extra rooms they had built on. She could hardly wait to get to such improvements herself. Clark had gone along with her ideas for a while. He had built new steps, and spent a lot of time looking for an old wrought-iron railing for them. He hadn\u2019t complained about the money spent on paint for the kitchen and bathroom or the material for curtains. What he did balk at was tearing up the carpet, which was the same in every room and the thing that she had most counted on replacing. It was divided into small brown squares, each with a pattern of darker brown, rust, and tan squiggles and shapes. For a long time, she had thought that the same squiggles and shapes were arranged the same way in each square. Then, when she had had more time, a lot of time, to examine them, she decided that there were four patterns joined together to make identical larger squares. Sometimes she could pick out the arrangement easily and sometimes she had to work to see it. She did this at times when Clark\u2019s mood had weighted down all their indoor space. The best thing then was to invent or remember some job to do in the barn. The horses would not look at her when she was unhappy, but Flora, who was never tied up, would come and rub against her, and look up with an expression that was not quite sympathy; it was more like comradely mockery in her shimmering yellow-green eyes.",

This connection with Flora became a vital part of Carla's life, a reminder that even in moments of discontent, there was a space where she felt understood and accepted. As Carla continued to navigate her mixed feelings about the mobile home and her relationship with Clark, she realized that her journey was not just about transforming a living space but also about redefining her own perspectives and finding solace in unexpected places.\n\nParagraph 2:\nUp until three years ago, Carla had never really looked at mobile homes. She hadn\u2019t called them that, either. Like her parents, she would have thought the term \u201cmobile home\u201d pretentious. Some people lived in trailers, and that was all there was to it. One trailer was no different from another. When she moved in here, when she chose this life with Clark, she began to see things in a new way. After that, it was only the mobile homes that she really looked at, to see how people had fixed them up\u2014the kind of curtains they had hung, the way they had painted the trim, the ambitious decks or patios or extra rooms they had built on. She could hardly wait to get to such improvements herself. Clark had gone along with her ideas for a while. He had built new steps, and spent a lot of time looking for an old wrought-iron railing for them. He hadn\u2019t complained about the money spent on paint for the kitchen and bathroom or the material for curtains. What he did balk at was tearing up the carpet, which was the same in every room and the thing that she had most counted on replacing. It was divided into small brown squares, each with a pattern of darker brown, rust, and tan squiggles and shapes. For a long time, she had thought that the same squiggles and shapes were arranged the same way in each square. Then, when she had had more time, a lot of time, to examine them, she decided that there were four patterns joined together to make identical larger squares. Sometimes she could pick out the arrangement easily and sometimes she had to work to see it. She did this at times when Clark\u2019s mood had weighted down all their indoor space. The best thing then was to invent or remember some job to do in the barn. The horses would not look at her when she was unhappy, but Flora, who was never tied up, would come and rub against her, and look up with an expression that was not quite sympathy; it was more like comradely mockery in her shimmering yellow-green eyes.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

My mother shared her general suspicion of locksmiths. Certainly, she said, they must have a copy of every single key to every single lock they\u2019d ever installed, or a magic key to all doors, and they entered people\u2019s homes to steal small items whose absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed for a while; worse, perhaps the locksmiths didn\u2019t steal anything, just took naps on beds that weren\u2019t theirs, drank out of people\u2019s favorite cups, shit in their toilets. Only other locksmiths ever had a clue. \u201cIn your case, though, it\u2019s not a locksmith who did the deed,\u201d my mother said. \u201cObviously. We\u2019re looking at someone who knows about old optical equipment. Did you tell the police that?\u201d My mother was glad about the burglary, in a way. She got to use all the knowledge that she\u2019d gleaned from reading crime novels for the past forty years. \u201cMaybe a former optometrist,\u201d she said, blowing her nose and folding the Kleenex neatly over the result. \u201cOr a failed one.\u201d Her building had implemented a new waste-sorting policy the previous month, and we\u2019d mostly been talking about that, so my burglary provided a welcome change of topic, at least. Just as I was thinking this, though, my mother asked which bin used tissues should go in. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering for days,\u201d she said. \u201cCan snot be recycled?\u201d \u201cWhen in doubt, throw it in the gray bin,\u201d I said. My mother doubted a lot. The gray bin was always full. \u201cI can put you in touch with my friend Rita for next week,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next week?\u201d \u201cWell, like, every Sunday, honey, there\u2019s the flea market on Pinto Square.\u201d \u201cAnd why would I go there with your friend Rita?\u201d I\u2019d never heard of Rita. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know about this!\u201d my mother said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s been burglarized goes to Pinto Square to see if their things resurface. People call it the Thieves\u2019 Market. You never heard that? China, lamps, small furniture\u2014lots of stolen property ends up there. I\u2019m surprised the cop who filed your complaint didn\u2019t tell you to go there first thing.\u201d \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t look desperate enough to get my stuff back,\u201d I said. And I wasn\u2019t. Insurance had me covered, and I\u2019d been thinking about getting rid of the TV for a while anyway\u2014I just wasn\u2019t sure how to dispose of it responsibly. \u201cOh, you\u2019re getting that case back,\u201d my mother said. \u201cIt\u2019s all I have left from your grandfather.\u201d \u201cI thought the watch you\u2019re wearing was his.

She\u2019d had a bad fall a few years earlier, and since then she\u2019d decided to limit her outings to what was strictly necessary, a category that didn\u2019t include socializing. Rita said that she was an \u201capartment therapist,\u201d which didn\u2019t help me imagine how they might\u2019ve met. My mother didn\u2019t even believe in therapy for people. Rita had told me to bring pictures of the stolen items, but I\u2019d never taken pictures of things, never really taken pictures in general, so I\u2019d pulled images of similar objects from the Internet and printed them at the office. \u201cI guess these will work,\u201d Rita said, and she sat on the ground to cut the images out and tape them (she carried scissors and tape in her purse) into a notebook deformed by dozens of other similar pasteups. My mother had told me that Rita had started coming to the market after having been burglarized herself, years before, and that, giving up on finding her own things, she\u2019d realized she knew how to navigate the place, and could be of help to the newly burglarized. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d I asked Rita. \u201cShould I pay you for every Sunday you spend looking, or only when you find something?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t your mom tell you?\u201d she said. \u201cI do this for free.\u201d Free things make me suspicious. \u201cNow, you\u2019re probably thinking a free service can\u2019t possibly be worth much,\u201d Rita said. \u201cBut I\u2019m actually pretty selfish in doing this.

    "paragraph2": "During a typical Sunday lunch, my mother and I found ourselves in the midst of a conversation that veered from the mundane to the unexpectedly intriguing, with our discussion centering on a recent burglary at my home. As we sat at the dining table, the familiar aroma of roasted chicken and potatoes wafting through the air, my mother, ever the skeptic, expressed her deep-seated distrust of locksmiths. She posited that the burglar might have had some knowledge of old optical equipment, given the peculiar items that were stolen. Her eyes twinkled with a mix of concern and excitement, an unusual combination that hinted at her secret delight in applying her extensive crime novel knowledge to a real-life scenario. She suggested that I take a trip to the local flea market, notoriously known as the \"Thieves' Market,\" to see if any of my stolen items might turn up there. It was a place she had heard about from her friend Rita, who had gained a reputation for helping people recover their stolen belongings without expecting anything in return. Intrigued by the prospect, I listened as my mother recounted Rita's story. Rita, once a victim of burglary herself, had turned her misfortune into a mission, dedicating her time to assisting others in similar predicaments. Her altruistic efforts were fueled by her understanding of the despair that accompanied losing treasured possessions, and she found solace in the camaraderie that the market fostered among those who had been wronged. As we continued our conversation, Rita's motivations became clearer. She believed that the market served a vital role in the community, not just as a place to potentially reclaim lost items but as a beacon of hope for those left in the wake of theft. The market, she explained, was intensely local, with many of the sellers and buyers hailing from nearby neighborhoods. It was this proximity that made it an effective venue for recovering stolen goods, as it provided a direct link between the victims and the possible conduits of their misplaced belongings. Rita's perspective extended beyond the market itself, touching on broader themes of community and the gradual erosion of societal structures. She shared an article she had recently read, which explored the idea of civilizations breaking down into smaller, more manageable groups. This concept resonated with her, as she saw the market as a microcosm of this phenomenon\u2014a small, self-sustaining community that arose from the ashes of broader societal collapse. By the time our lunch plates had been cleared, I felt a curious blend of unease and optimism. The notion that my stolen items might be lurking somewhere within the bustling stalls of the \"Thieves' Market\" was both unsettling and strangely hopeful. My mother's enthusiasm for the mystery at hand, coupled with Rita's inspiring story, left me contemplating not only the fate of my possessions but also the resilience of communities in the face of adversity. As I sat there, digesting both my meal and the weighty topics we had delved into, I realized that this unexpected conversation had opened my eyes to the intricate web of human connections that often go unnoticed, but which can provide comfort and support in times of need.",

    "paragraph1": "After Christmas, my search for employment became a daily ritual, with my mother dutifully driving me to various interviews across town, her unwavering support both comforting and slightly pressuring as we navigated the winter streets together. It wasn't until we reached the law office of Ned Johnson in Westland that something finally clicked, though at the time, the experience felt surreal and disconnected, like watching scenes from someone else's life play out before me. Ned Johnson himself was an intriguing figure \u2013 a short, thick-bodied man whose active eyes seemed to catch every detail while simultaneously conveying a warmth that put me at ease despite my nervousness. The interview itself was anything but conventional; we exchanged what could only be described as odd remarks, our conversation meandering through topics that seemed barely related to the secretarial position I was applying for, yet somehow this unusual dynamic worked in my favor. When he offered me the job, I felt a mixture of relief and curiosity about what working in this peculiar environment would entail. My parents' evident pleasure at my securing the position added another layer of complexity to my emotions, their approval both reassuring and slightly overwhelming. The office itself was a reflection of Ned's personality \u2013 charmingly mismatched furniture created an atmosphere that was more living room than law office, and the parade of eccentric clients who passed through the door each day added color and interest to my daily routine. What struck me most was Ned's teaching style; unlike my school experiences where I had often felt isolated and afraid, his approach was consistently encouraging and sincere, making even the most challenging tasks seem manageable. There was something deeply comforting about the predictability of our office interactions, the clear communication and expectations that allowed me to gradually build confidence in my abilities. The filing systems, phone protocols, and legal documentation processes that initially seemed daunting became familiar territory under his patient guidance, and I found myself developing a sense of competence that had eluded me in previous settings. The contrast between the structured yet nurturing environment of Ned's office and my prior experiences of feeling lost and undervalued was stark, and I began to understand that sometimes the most unexpected opportunities can lead to the most significant personal growth. Each day brought new challenges, from dealing with difficult clients to mastering complex legal terminology, but Ned's unwavering support and genuine interest in my development made these challenges feel like stepping stones rather than obstacles. The office became more than just a workplace; it transformed into a space where I could be myself while learning and growing professionally, where mistakes were viewed as learning opportunities rather than failures, and where the quirky atmosphere and diverse clientele created a uniquely accepting environment. Looking back, I realize that what might have seemed like an odd fit at first glance \u2013 the nervous job seeker and the unconventional lawyer \u2013 turned out to be exactly what I needed at that point in my life. The position offered not just employment but a chance to develop skills and confidence in an environment that celebrated individuality while maintaining professional standards. Ned's approach to mentoring, combined with the office's welcoming atmosphere, helped me overcome my previous insecurities and discover capabilities I hadn't known I possessed. The daily routine of managing appointments, handling correspondence, and interacting with clients became more than just job duties; they became opportunities to prove to myself that I could handle responsibility and contribute meaningfully to something larger than myself. The mismatched furniture and eclectic collection of clients that initially seemed strange became symbolic of the office's accepting nature, where differences were celebrated rather than criticize",
    "paragraph2": "After Christmas, I looked for a job. The ads in the newspaper were for low-paying jobs, like file clerk or telephone solicitor or receptionist. My mother drove me to interviews for maybe a week before I found a secretarial position that didn\u2019t require experience, working for a lawyer in Westland named Ned Johnson. The office was in a small house, brick, with stiff fir trees on either side of the door and a flower box under the window. My mother waited in the car while I went to the door. Ned Johnson was there by himself. Given that he would wander my dream-mind for decades, I don\u2019t know why my memory of our first meeting is so vague, obscured by disconnected feelings that move like clouds or greasy smoke across the receding moment. He was a short, thick-bodied man with deep, shining, active eyes. I was startled by him without knowing why. During the interview, I said weird things I wouldn\u2019t normally say. He told me that the job was dull, and I said, \u201cI like dull work.\u201d He stared as if he were insulted, and I thought the interview was over\u2014but instead he said something weird. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s something off about you. You\u2019re closed and tight, like a wall.\u201d And I just said, \u201cI know.\u201d When my mother asked how the interview went, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he liked me.\u201d But the next day a girl called and told me he wanted to hire me. She said I could start tomorrow if it was convenient. My parents were really happy. I remember my father smiling, holding a can of beer and some peanuts; there was something special for dessert. The people who came into the office were odds and ends in human form: a man with a scar on his face who was suing his neighbors because their dog barked \u201call goddam day,\u201d a middle-aged Black woman in mod teen clothes, an old Russian lady in a purple coat. The furniture, too, was comically mismatched, and there was too much of it for the low-ceilinged rectangular room: two cheap swollen couches faced each other before my grossly big oak desk, which itself pointlessly faced two haughty high-backed armchairs, positioned as if for an important meeting that never took place. But I liked the strange furniture. It made the lawyer seem more human because it offset his extreme consistency, his choppy economical movements, his always shining eyes. His style of training was loud and cheerful, full of stressful encouragement. When I did something right, he would clap his hands and say, \u201cShe\u2019s coming along!\u201d If I made a mistake, he would say, \u201cSlowly, slowly!\u201d or \u201cJust do the best you can!\u201d It was the same voice he used to greet a client he liked, the old lady from Russia who wore the purple coat with a thick sash knotted around her crumpled waist. She was the only foreigner I had ever met and she was the only person the lawyer came out of his office to meet, instead of just buzzing me to send her in. When she was next on the list, he would open his door and say, \u201cThere\u2019s my girlfriend!,\u201d and she would rise and wobble toward him with fierce, caneless dignity. His attention to her made me trust him. Because there were clients that he did not like at all and he didn\u2019t bother to hide it from me, saying things like \u201cHe is completely crazy\u201d or \u201cI feel sorry for her husband.\u201d He was sincere in his likes and dislikes. When Donna asked me how the job was, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.\u201d But I liked it more than that because it was so much better than school. At school, I\u2019d had no friends, except for a girl named Sandy, and the only thing we had in common was that we both liked animals. I almost never talked, because I didn\u2019t know how; I couldn\u2019t understand the way other kids talked to one another. I felt afraid all the time. I was afraid of saying something wrong, and I was afraid of being mocked or bullied the way I had been in elementary school. What was strange about this: I was good with words. I was in honors English and history because I could write papers. But I couldn\u2019t make my ability with written words transfer to the bewildering clash of people talking, their faces and voices coloring their words with too many expressions to respond to.

They moved here six months ago, drawn by the promise of opportunity in the city's growing tech industry. Having grown up in a small inland town, the coastal environment feels both exciting and unsettling to them. Their living space contains both their past and future: Sara's family heirlooms sit alongside Hassan's cutting-edge gadgets, symbolizing the struggle to reconcile their roots with their ambitions. The close quarters amplify their differences \u2013 Sara's neat organization clashing with Hassan's creative chaos \u2013 yet also force them to confront and resolve conflicts quickly. They both feel a mix of gratitude for having escaped their hometown's limited prospects and anxiety about the uncertainties ahead.

Michael wasn\u2019t my oldest friend and he wasn\u2019t my closest friend, but he was older than any of the ones who were closer and closer than any of the ones who were older, so he had a special status, as part of the furniture of my life, the kind of friend who when you\u2019re asked how you met you have to think for a while to remember. What he certainly was, though, unequivocally and by a huge margin, was my richest friend. Michael was loaded, seriously and unambiguously loaded. He was the kind of rich that even other people who were rich considered rich. He had made the money himself. It was all the more impressive because Michael seemed barely to have noticed. His peers and friends and rivals and colleagues were all amazed by the fact that Mike was now some kind of gazillionaire, but it didn\u2019t seem to make much impression on Michael himself.",
    "paragraph2": "Standing at King's Cross station with Toby and Mia, I found myself embroiled in what seemed like the hundredth attempt to instill some basic social graces into these tech-obsessed children. \"You can't just barge into Uncle Mike's house and immediately demand his Wi-Fi password,\" I explained, watching their faces contort with mild annoyance. Toby, all of nine years old and already too clever for his own good, rolled his eyes while seven-year-old Mia clutched her tablet expectantly. \"But Uncle Mike won't mind,\" they chorused, and I couldn't help but smile at their innocent assumption that their beloved uncle's legendary good nature somehow exempted them from basic courtesy. Toby, recently exposed to classic films, threw me a curve ball by quoting \"Trading Places\" with surprising timing, making me wonder if I was fighting a losing battle. The mention of Michael made me pause and reflect on our friendship, a relationship that had weathered decades of changes. Here was a man who had built his fortune from scratch, amassing wealth that would make most people's heads spin, yet he remained remarkably unchanged by it all. It was this quality that earned him not just respect but genuine admiration from everyone who knew him. The children's eagerness to connect to his Wi-Fi was, in its own way, a testament to how approachable he remained despite his success, though I remained determined to teach them that even the most accommodating hosts deserve a proper greeting first.",

His peers and friends and rivals and colleagues were all amazed by the fact that Mike was now some kind of gazillionaire, but it didn\u2019t seem to make much impression on Michael himself.\n\nParagraph 2:\nStanding at King's Cross station with Toby and Mia, I found myself embroiled in what seemed like the hundredth attempt to instill some basic social graces into these tech-obsessed children. \"You can't just barge into Uncle Mike's house and immediately demand his Wi-Fi password,\" I explained, watching their faces contort with mild annoyance. Toby, all of nine years old and already too clever for his own good, rolled his eyes while seven-year-old Mia clutched her tablet expectantly. \"But Uncle Mike won't mind,\" they chorused, and I couldn't help but smile at their innocent assumption that their beloved uncle's legendary good nature somehow exempted them from basic courtesy. Toby, recently exposed to classic films, threw me a curve ball by quoting \"Trading Places\" with surprising timing, making me wonder if I was fighting a losing battle. The mention of Michael made me pause and reflect on our friendship, a relationship that had weathered decades of changes. Here was a man who had built his fortune from scratch, amassing wealth that would make most people's heads spin, yet he remained remarkably unchanged by it all. It was this quality that earned him not just respect but genuine admiration from everyone who knew him. The children's eagerness to connect to his Wi-Fi was, in its own way, a testament to how approachable he remained despite his success, though I remained determined to teach them that even the most accommodating hosts deserve a proper greeting first.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The air was still, and the early morning light filtered gently through the curtains, casting a serene glow over the simple furnishings. Dressed in a dark blue dressing gown and matching slippers, Samsa found solace in the uncomplicated attire, a choice that offered ease and familiarity amidst the complexities of daily life. The simple fabric felt smooth against his skin, a welcome alternative to the often cumbersome and intricate clothing he typically avoided. Yet, the tranquility of the morning was abruptly shattered by the persistent ringing of the doorbell, a sound that cut through the silence with unyielding insistence. It was this noise, echoing persistently through the house, that roused Samsa from his drowsy state, urging him to rise from the comfort of his bed. With a sigh, he reached for his walking stick, a steadfast companion that not only provided physical support but a sense of security as he navigated the challenges of mobility. Carefully, he maneuvered himself out of bed, each movement deliberate and measured to avoid the danger of falling, a constant concern in his daily routine. The journey to the door was not a swift one, but Samsa approached it with patience, descending the stairs with cautious steps, the tap of his walking stick marking his progress. Upon reaching the door, he paused briefly, steadying himself before turning the handle and opening it to reveal the world beyond. There, on the doorstep, stood a young woman, her presence both unexpected and intriguing. Her posture was stooped, a subtle curvature that lent her an appearance of smallness despite the average proportions of her frame. Her hair, a rich chestnut hue, caught the light in a way that accentuated its natural warmth, cascading around her shoulders in gentle waves. She wore a tweed jacket, its texture adding an air of sophistication to her ensemble, paired with a loose skirt that moved softly with the breeze. The combination of her attire and demeanor presented a curious blend of youthful vibrancy and mature wisdom. Her eyes, however, held a skeptical expression, a look that suggested she approached the world with a questioning gaze, probing beneath the surface of things. It was a look that could both challenge and engage, demanding attention and reflection. As Samsa stood before her, he took in these details, each one painting a vivid picture of the visitor who had interrupted his morning. Her presence hinted at stories untold, mysteries wrapped in the everyday fabric of life, and as they exchanged greetings, Samsa was drawn into the subtle complexities of their encounter, his curiosity piqued by the unexpected blend of characteristics she embodied. In that moment, the ordinary act of answering the door became a doorway to possibilities, a reminder of the rich tapestry of human interaction and the unpredictable nature of the world outside his door.",
    "paragraph2": "Samsa found a dressing gown his size in the closet of the largest room. It looked like something he might be able to manage. He hadn\u2019t a clue what to do with the other clothes\u2014how to put them on, how to wear them. They were just too complicated: too many buttons, for one thing, and he was unsure how to tell front from back, or top from bottom. Which was supposed to go on the outside, and which underneath? The dressing gown, on the other hand, was simple, practical, and quite free of ornament. Its light, soft cloth felt good against his skin, and its color was dark blue. He even turned up a matching pair of slippers. He pulled the dressing gown over his naked body and, after much trial and error, succeeded in fastening the belt around his waist. He looked at himself in the mirror, clad now in gown and slippers. This was certainly better than walking around naked. It wasn\u2019t as warm as it might have been, to be sure, but as long as he remained indoors it would stave off the cold. Best of all, he no longer had to worry that his soft skin would be exposed to vicious birds. When the doorbell rang, Samsa was dozing in the biggest room (and in the biggest bed) in the house. It was warm under the feather quilts, as cozy as if he were sleeping in an egg. He woke from a dream. He couldn\u2019t remember it in detail, but it had been pleasant and cheerful. The bell echoing through the house, however, yanked him back to cold reality. He dragged himself from the bed, fastened his gown, put on his dark-blue slippers, grabbed his black walking stick, and, hand on railing, tottered down the stairs. It was far easier than it had been on the first occasion. Still, the danger of falling was ever present. He could not afford to let down his guard. Keeping a close eye on his feet, he picked his way down the stairs one step at a time, as the doorbell continued to ring. Whoever was pushing the buzzer had to be a most impatient and stubborn person. Walking stick in his left hand, Samsa approached the front door. He twisted the knob to the right and pulled, and the door swung in. A little woman was standing outside. A very little woman. It was a wonder she was able to reach the buzzer. When he looked more closely, however, he realized that the issue wasn\u2019t her size. It was her back, which was bent forward in a perpetual stoop. This made her appear small, though, in fact, her frame was of normal dimensions. She had fastened her hair with a rubber band to prevent it from spilling over her face. The hair was a deep chestnut and very abundant. She was dressed in a battered tweed jacket and a full, loose-fitting skirt that covered her ankles. A striped cotton scarf was wrapped around her neck. She wore no hat. Her shoes were of the tall lace-up variety, and she appeared to be in her early twenties. There was still something of the girl about her. Her eyes were big, her nose small, and her lips twisted a little to one side, like a skinny moon. Her dark eyebrows formed two straight lines across her forehead, giving her a skeptical look.",

    "paragraph1": "Listening to \"URML,\" a song by Mr. Jackson, has fundamentally altered my perception of life and time, offering an experience so profound that it seems to transcend the ordinary boundaries of understanding. As I immerse myself in its rhythm and melody, I find myself transported to a mental realm where life's significance shifts, becoming both more and less than I previously imagined. There's a transformative power in the music that unveils hidden truths and possibilities, whispering secrets that feel both personal and universal. I feel an immense gratitude for this gift, for the way it gently nudges me to view the world through a different lens, where the mundane becomes magical and the complex becomes simple. It is as if Mr. Jackson has unlocked a door to another dimension, inviting me and my son to step through and explore the boundless potential of our existence.

As I immerse myself in its rhythm and melody, I find myself transported to a mental realm where life's significance shifts, becoming both more and less than I previously imagined. There's a transformative power in the music that unveils hidden truths and possibilities, whispering secrets that feel both personal and universal. I feel an immense gratitude for this gift, for the way it gently nudges me to view the world through a different lens, where the mundane becomes magical and the complex becomes simple.

He was rough and angry and mean, it was true\u2014a bully. But not to me. I knew how to handle him. I would talk soothingly to him, as if he were a stray dog. I could even pull him off his victims. His body had a sweaty, gooey sensation of unhappy fat. Under him, a boy would beg for mercy, but Jackie, alone in his rage, would be far from the regular world. When I pulled him off, he would continue to flail, at war with ghosts, until, through his hate-filled little eyes, something soft peered out, and, if it was me that he saw, he might sputter some burning explanation and then run home.

Jackie lived in a house just a few doors down from my apartment, and while others saw him as rough and mean, I had a peculiar ability to calm him, much like one would soothe a stray dog. Jackie had a troubled home life, which I believed contributed significantly to his behavior. His mother had passed away, leaving him in the care of a father who was not only abusive but also saw Jackie as little more than a burden. This harsh view was matched by his stepmother, May, who did nothing to ease the burden of his upbringing. In our neighborhood, all the children, myself included, were no strangers to physical discipline. Our parents were laborers, hardened by their own struggles, and saw physical discipline as a necessary tool for raising their children. The nuns at school were no different, perpetuating a culture of violence that trickled down to us kids.

He wasn\u2019t born a bully; rather, he was molded by the relentless challenges of his family dynamics and the unforgiving environment we all inhabited. While other children responded to their harsh realities with varying degrees of acceptance or rebellion, Jackie lashed out, perhaps as a defense mechanism against a world that seemed constantly against him. I understood this, perhaps more than anyone else, and it allowed me to connect with him in a way that defied his usual behavior. Our interactions were like a quiet truce amidst the chaos, moments where Jackie seemed to find a sliver of peace. I imagined that in those rare instances, he could momentarily escape the adversarial world he lived in. Our neighborhood was a place where the adults\u2019 struggles bled into the lives of the children, creating a cycle of hardship that seemed unbreakable. Yet, despite the bleakness of our surroundings, I found a strange kinship with Jackie. Though he was often feared, I couldn\u2019t help but see the scared, hurt boy beneath the tough exterior. It was this understanding that drove me to approach him with empathy rather than fear, and in doing so, I discovered the power of compassion in the face of adversity. Jackie\u2019s story was a reminder that behind every tough demeanor lies a narrative of struggle, and sometimes, all it takes is a little kindness to uncover the vulnerability hidden beneath.

I think you might want to know how it happened.\u201d I could not figure out how to speak. \u201cI was stoned,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, furthermore, I\u2019m not a swimmer. Not many swimming pools around where I grew up. I\u2019d have drowned, too. Is that what you wanted to know?\u201d I said that he was not really the one that I was wondering about. Then he became the third person I\u2019d asked, \u201cWhat do you think Caro had in mind?\u201d The counsellor had said that we couldn\u2019t know. \u201cLikely she herself didn\u2019t know what she wanted. Attention? I don\u2019t think she meant to drown herself. Attention to how bad she was feeling?\u201d Ruthann had said, \u201cTo make your mother do what she wanted? Make her smarten up and see that she had to go back to your father?\u201d Neal said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Maybe she thought she could paddle better than she could. Maybe she didn\u2019t know how heavy winter clothes can get. Or that there wasn\u2019t anybody in a position to help her.\u201d He said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time. You\u2019re not thinking what if you had hurried up and told, are you? Not trying to get in on the guilt?\u201d I said that I had considered what he was saying, but no. \u201cThe thing is to be happy,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what. Just try that. You can. It gets to be easier and easier. It\u2019s nothing to do with circumstances. You wouldn\u2019t believe how good it is. Accept everything and then tragedy disappears. Or tragedy lightens, anyway, and you\u2019re just there, going along easy in the world.\u201d Now, goodbye. I see what he meant. It really is the right thing to do. But, in my mind, Caro keeps running at the water and throwing herself, as if in triumph, and I\u2019m still caught, waiting for her to explain to me, waiting for the splash.\n\nParagraph 2:\nI sat across from Neal, barely registering his elaborate tales of weekend adventures, my mind fixated on the one question that had been haunting me for months.

And so she kept vigil faithfully for hours in the quiet of the night, presiding over the mystery of her changed life, adjusting her body against the peremptory curve of his turned back and legs in the narrow single bed. But at last she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014she fell asleep herself. And when she awoke in the morning Daniel was gone. After a while, when he didn\u2019t come back, she put on her underclothes and her dress, and set off around the house in search of him. Downstairs, she smelled Paddy\u2019s sweat and saw the tousled mess of his hair, poking from the top of a sleeping bag on the sofa in the lounge. Nigel was making a racket outside with the sliding door of the garage, in search of the net for the swimming pool. Jane climbed upstairs again. Nigel\u2019s parents\u2019 bedroom was at the front of the house, opening off the landing ahead of her; the door was ajar, and Jane stepped soundlessly inside. It was a beautiful room, like nothing she\u2019d ever seen before, with a pale wood floor and plain white walls, creamy sheepskin rugs. Fresh sunlight, pouring through windows all along its length, was reflected in the mirrored doors of the built-in wardrobes; the curtains, in some kind of rough white translucent linen, were cut too long for the windows, and the cloth fell in heaps on the floor. A huge bed seemed to be all white sheets and no blankets. (Jane had never seen a duvet before.) In the bed, with the duvet kicked to their feet, Daniel and Fiona lay naked and asleep, facing away from each other, their slim tanned legs tangled together. Jane, who had done the Greeks in history, thought that they looked like young warriors in a classical scene, fallen in the place where they had been wrestling. She withdrew from the room without waking them, as quietly as she had come in. Nigel, rather the worse for wear, in his pajama bottoms, was smoking and skimming the pool, dumping the rubbish in a soaking heap beside him. He watched when Jane came to stand at the pool\u2019s brink; she stared in with dry, hot eyes. \u201cSo now you know,\u201d he said. But she repudiated his offer of companionship in her unrequited love. Her experience was not like anyone else\u2019s. She asked only if he would drive her home, and he said he\u2019d get the car out as soon as he\u2019d finished with the pool. \u201cI\u2019d like to go now,\u201d she said crisply, sounding like her mother. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d On the way back, they hardly spoke, except when Nigel asked for directions as they drew near the house. Jane forgot, in her absorption, to notice the way they\u2019d come, so that she never afterward knew where she\u2019d been. And she never saw Nigel\u2019s house again, or any of the boys (Fiona once, perhaps, at a party). He dropped her off at the bottom of the drive. It was still quite early in the morning\u2014only nine o\u2019clock. Jane stared around her as if she\u2019d never seen the place before, as if it were more mysterious than anywhere she\u2019d been\u2014the scuffed dirt at the edge of the road, the old mossy gateposts, blackbirds flitting in the dead leaves at the bottom of the hedge, the hard lime-yellow fruits in the hedge apple tree, her own footprints from the day before intact in the dust, the Jokari paddle left where she had dropped it.",
    "paragraph2": "Jane's vigil through the long night, watching Daniel's turned back in the darkness, dissolved into a morning of hollow discoveries and irreversible revelations. The empty space beside her in bed triggered an immediate search through the house, her footsteps echoing against wooden floors and her heart drumming an increasingly anxious rhythm until she reached the fateful bedroom door. There, the scene that greeted her struck with the weight of ancient Greek tragedy: Daniel and Fiona's naked bodies intertwined in sleep, their peaceful expressions a cruel contrast to the turmoil erupting within her chest. The sight burned itself into her memory with the persistence of a branded mark, forcing her to withdraw with the quiet grace of someone who had witnessed something both sacred and profane. The hallway seemed longer on her retreat, each step carrying her further from a reality she had hoped to create and closer to one she never wanted to accept. Outside, the morning sun cast an almost mocking brightness over the scene, where Nigel methodically skimmed the pool's surface, creating ripples that mirrored the disturbances in Jane's emotional waters. His offered companionship, though genuine, bounced off the protective shell she had already begun to form around herself, and her request for a ride home emerged as much from a desire to flee as from practical necessity. The car journey unfolded in a cocoon of silence, with Jane so deeply entrenched in her internal landscape that the external world became a blur of meaningless shapes and colors, effectively erasing the route from her memory \u2013 a subconscious act of self-preservation ensuring she would never retrace these steps to Nigel's house or cross paths with the boys again. The familiar contours of her own home, when finally reached, appeared transformed through the lens of her altered perspective, every familiar object and corner suddenly imbued with an otherworldly quality, as if she had returned to a place that was simultaneously home and not home, known and unknown. The morning's events had created a fissure in her reality, through which even the most mundane aspects of her life now seemed to emit a strange, almost supernatural glow, marking the beginning of a profound disconnection from her previous understanding of love, trust, and belonging. The weight of her unrequited love hung heavy in the air of her home, transforming the space into a museum of what could have been, each room holding echoes of possibilities that would never materialize, while the physical distance she had put between herself and the morning's discovery seemed to only emphasize the emotional chasm that had opened within her. The sunlight streaming through her windows illuminated dust particles dancing in the air, their random movements somehow embodying the chaos she felt inside, while the familiar sounds of her neighborhood \u2013 children playing, cars passing, birds singing \u2013 created a surreal soundtrack to her altered state of consciousness, highlighting how the world continued its normal rhythm even as her personal universe had shifted on its axis.",

And so she kept vigil faithfully for hours in the quiet of the night, presiding over the mystery of her changed life, adjusting her body against the peremptory curve of his turned back and legs in the narrow single bed. But at last she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014she fell asleep herself. And when she awoke in the morning Daniel was gone. After a while, when he didn\u2019t come back, she put on her underclothes and her dress, and set off around the house in search of him. Downstairs, she smelled Paddy\u2019s sweat and saw the tousled mess of his hair, poking from the top of a sleeping bag on the sofa in the lounge. Nigel was making a racket outside with the sliding door of the garage, in search of the net for the swimming pool. Jane climbed upstairs again.

    "paragraph1": "The tension in our house reached its breaking point when Rafa finally returned after three days of complete silence, during which Mami had barely slept, constantly pacing between the window and the phone. When he walked through the door with Pura by his side, something in Mami's eyes changed \u2013 a mixture of relief instantly morphing into confusion, then anger. \"We got married,\" Rafa announced, his voice carrying a defiant pride that made my stomach twist. Mami's face drained of color as she processed the news, her hands gripping the kitchen counter so hard her knuckles turned white. I stood in the corner, watching the scene unfold like a witness to an inevitable crash. \"\u00bfEst\u00e1s loco?\" Mami's voice trembled, barely above a whisper at first, then rising like a storm. \"How could you do this? With your condition? Without telling me?\" Rafa's health had always been a source of worry for all of us, but he hated being reminded of it, and I could see his jaw tightening at Mami's words. Pura stood slightly behind him, her face a mask of discomfort and determination. The argument escalated quickly, with Mami's words becoming sharper, more cutting, as she demanded they leave her house immediately. \"You want to play husband? Then go be a man and provide for your wife somewhere else!\" she shouted, her accent thickening with emotion. Rafa started to argue back, his voice matching her intensity, but there was a hint of desperation in it that I hadn't heard before. I wanted to intervene, to say something that would make everything okay, but the words stuck in my throat. The air in the room felt thick with unspoken feelings and years of complicated history. Finally, after what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes, Rafa grabbed Pura's hand and headed for the door. He paused briefly, looking back at Mami with a mixture of hurt and anger that made him seem both older and younger than his years. \"V\u00e1monos,\" he said to Pura, his voice now eerily calm. As they left, Mami turned away, her shoulders shaking slightly, but she didn't make a sound. I stood there, torn between following my brother and comforting my mother, feeling the weight of family loyalty pulling me in opposite directions. The sound of the front door closing echoed through the house like a gunshot, marking the moment our family dynamic changed forever. The silence that followed was deafening, filled with all the things we should have said differently, all the ways we could have handled it better, and all the love that somehow got lost in translation between generations and expectations.",
    "paragraph2": "A couple weeks later, Rafa disappeared. Took the Monarch and vanished. No note or telephone call, nada. Gone for one day, gone for two. By then Mami was starting to flip seriously out. Had the Four Horsefaces putting out an A.P.B. on the godline. Walked around the neighborhood asking everybody if they\u2019d seen my brother, even the gringos, and my mother had to be under serious duress to speak to a gringo. I was starting to worry, too, remembering that when he was first diagnosed he\u2019d jumped into his ride and tried to drive to Miami, where he had some boy or another. He hadn\u2019t made it past Philly before his car broke down. I wondered if he was on his way to Cali or something. He\u2019d always wanted to see L.A. One of his dreams. I got worried enough that I walked over to Tammy Franco\u2019s house, but when her Polack husband answered the door I lost my nerve. I turned around and walked away. On the third night we were in the apartment just waiting when the Monarch pulled up. My mother ran over to the porch. Holding the curtains until her knuckles were white. No, she said finally. Rafa stomped in with Pura in tow. He was clearly drunk, and Pura was dressed as if they\u2019d just been at a club. Where have you been? Mami said. Check it out, Rafa said, holding out both his and Pura\u2019s hands. They had rings on. We got married! It\u2019s totally official, Pura said giddily, pulling the license from her purse. You should have seen the expression on my mother\u2019s face. It was worse than when my father ran off with his putika. Worse than when the doctor had first said the word \u201cleukemia.\u201d Her face drained of everything. Is she pregnant? Not yet, Pura said. Is she pregnant? My mother looked straight at my brother. No, Rafa said. I\u2019m going to be moving in, cu\u00f1ada. Pura went to hug my mother. Let\u2019s have a drink, my brother said. My mother stopped Pura with an upraised finger.

When he walked through the door with Pura by his side, something in Mami's eyes changed \u2013 a mixture of relief instantly morphing into confusion, then anger. \"We got married,\" Rafa announced, his voice carrying a defiant pride that made my stomach twist. Mami's face drained of color as she processed the news, her hands gripping the kitchen counter so hard her knuckles turned white. I stood in the corner, watching the scene unfold like a witness to an inevitable crash. \"\u00bfEst\u00e1s loco?\" Mami's voice trembled, barely above a whisper at first, then rising like a storm. \"How could you do this? With your condition? Without telling me?\" Rafa's health had always been a source of worry for all of us, but he hated being reminded of it, and I could see his jaw tightening at Mami's words. Pura stood slightly behind him, her face a mask of discomfort and determination. The argument escalated quickly, with Mami's words becoming sharper, more cutting, as she demanded they leave her house immediately. \"You want to play husband? Then go be a man and provide for your wife somewhere else!\" she shouted, her accent thickening with emotion. Rafa started to argue back, his voice matching her intensity, but there was a hint of desperation in it that I hadn't heard before. I wanted to intervene, to say something that would make everything okay, but the words stuck in my throat. The air in the room felt thick with unspoken feelings and years of complicated history. Finally, after what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes, Rafa grabbed Pura's hand and headed for the door. He paused briefly, looking back at Mami with a mixture of hurt and anger that made him seem both older and younger than his years. \"V\u00e1monos,\" he said to Pura, his voice now eerily calm. As they left, Mami turned away, her shoulders shaking slightly, but she didn't make a sound. I stood there, torn between following my brother and comforting my mother, feeling the weight of family loyalty pulling me in opposite directions. The sound of the front door closing echoed through the house like a gunshot, marking the moment our family dynamic changed forever. The silence that followed was deafening, filled with all the things we should have said differently, all the ways we could have handled it better, and all the love that somehow got lost in translation between generations and expectations.\n\nParagraph 2:\nA couple weeks later, Rafa disappeared. Took the Monarch and vanished. No note or telephone call, nada. Gone for one day, gone for two. By then Mami was starting to flip seriously out. Had the Four Horsefaces putting out an A.P.B. on the godline. Walked around the neighborhood asking everybody if they\u2019d seen my brother, even the gringos, and my mother had to be under serious duress to speak to a gringo. I was starting to worry, too, remembering that when he was first diagnosed he\u2019d jumped into his ride and tried to drive to Miami, where he had some boy or another. He hadn\u2019t made it past Philly before his car broke down. I wondered if he was on his way to Cali or something. He\u2019d always wanted to see L.A. One of his dreams. I got worried enough that I walked over to Tammy Franco\u2019s house, but when her Polack husband answered the door I lost my nerve. I turned around and walked away. On the third night we were in the apartment just waiting when the Monarch pulled up. My mother ran over to the porch. Holding the curtains until her knuckles were white. No, she said finally. Rafa stomped in with Pura in tow. He was clearly drunk, and Pura was dressed as if they\u2019d just been at a club. Where have you been? Mami said. Check it out, Rafa said, holding out both his and Pura\u2019s hands. They had rings on. We got married! It\u2019s totally official, Pura said giddily, pulling the license from her purse. You should have seen the expression on my mother\u2019s face. It was worse than when my father ran off with his putika. Worse than when the doctor had first said the word \u201cleukemia.\u201d Her face drained of everything. Is she pregnant? Not yet, Pura said. Is she pregnant? My mother looked straight at my brother. No, Rafa said. I\u2019m going to be moving in, cu\u00f1ada. Pura went to hug my mother. Let\u2019s have a drink, my brother said. My mother stopped Pura with an upraised finger. No one is drinking in my house. I\u2019m having a drink. My brother walked toward the kitchen but my mother stiff-armed him. Ma, Rafa said. No one is drinking in this house. She pushed Rafa back.

She\u2019d sneaked out like a teen-ager and come home different, out of joint, as if she\u2019d lost her virginity. \u201cI see a satellite,\u201d Amalie announced, but Toni\u2019s focus was earthbound. She was planning something in her head. She felt it all there, laid out. A structure she could borrow. A new sense of urgency. \u201cI see Mars.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, honey.\u201d He would be another set of eyes. He would keep an eye. The moment she decided, she decided everything. Where she\u2019d put her bureau, which room Amalie would get. Where Toni would set up a desk. Where she would try one more time. Slow down, she told herself, but then she thought, Why should I slow down? She had been too humble, too modest. The edges of the sky lightened. A seam appeared in the horizon, and they went inside. In the apartment, Amalie hugged Toni around the waist\u2014hugged her hard, encircling her totally, the way she had as a toddler. She made a move to return to bed, but Toni took her wrist and said no. \u201cNo?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s end the night in a doughnut shop.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the morning already!\u201d But that was what Toni wanted. Like in graduate school. Like the early-morning diner after the first time you\u2019ve been with someone. Coffee after a hookup. So that she could linger in this state, so that Amalie would remember it longer. They drove to the Christmas-themed doughnut shop off Exit 5 and Toni ordered half a dozen, what the hell, to celebrate. \u201cTo celebrate? What are we celebrating?\u201d They sat across from each other in a hard plastic yellow booth. On a shelf above them, several mechanical Santas were frozen in hip gyrations. \u201cYou!\u201d Toni said, lifting her coffee. The girl made a doubtful face, blinked her red-rimmed eyes. There was still a faint indentation around her eye socket, from the telescope. \u201cYou and the cosmos, honey. The sky. That\u2019s what.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Amalie said, taking a large bite. Toni allowed Amalie a few sips of coffee. Sugar granules sparkled on her cheeks. People came and went. Mostly old men. Toni said, \u201cWe should thank the man who gave you the telescope.\u201d \u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to him.\u201d \u201cI checked him out.\u201d \u201cYou did? When?\u201d An elderly man in a stained shirt and green-tinted glasses\u2014looking toward Amalie\u2014smiled and pressed a button on a Santa across the room, the tallest Santa, who began to gyrate and sing. He was trying to please her, the only child in the place. Amalie winced like a woman with a hangover, looked out the window. The Santa crackled dementedly. Toni said, \u201cWe should give him a doughnut.\u201d \u201cHim?\u201d She thought Toni meant the man who started up the Santa. \u201cMarco.\u201d \u201cWait. Who\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cThe man who gave you the telescope. His name is Marco.\u201d Amalie stopped eating. She blinked her long lashes. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cIt would be nice.\u201d Amalie thought about it. \u201cA lemon,\u201d she said finally, looking into the box at the remaining doughnuts. Lemon were her least favorite. Then she tapped her watch, reminded her mother it was a school day. As they were leaving, she passed the man who had made the Santa dance, and he put his hand out, the way one does for a high five, a meaty palm, but Amalie sailed by, did not pause. Amalie my anomaly, her mother thought. Good girl. Just like that. In the parking lot, a big black bird tore at a garbage bag. Empty cans skidded across the pavement. A storm was coming, like Amalie had said. They were stuffed to the gills with sugar and caffeine. The school nurse would call in two hours. By that point, Toni would have called in sick herself, would be home napping. But before the nap. Before Amalie throws up in the coatroom. While the sky is so lovely and strange and their glucose levels have not yet plummeted\u2014she feels entitled to everything she wants. Ambition is ascendant. Danger everywhere, but it\u2019s not\u2014look at that\u2014in this story. In this story, no one lays a finger on any child. The wind lifts Amalie\u2019s hair. Toni lets her ride in the front seat. When she starts the car, the radio is already playing the right song, Freddie Mercury announcing a homicide, and they sing together, and it ends just when she pulls up to the school, as if God himself had set the needle down.",
    "paragraph2": "Toni stood quietly in the dim light of the early morning, her mind a swirl of thoughts and possibilities as she contemplated the subtle yet profound changes she felt brewing in her life and home. There was a sense of urgency in her, a desire to seize the day and create meaningful moments with her daughter, Amalie. This morning felt different, charged with an energy that compelled Toni to shake up their routine. Inspired by her own cherished childhood memories, she decided to take Amalie to a doughnut shop before school, a place that held its own kind of magic. As they drove through the awakening city, Toni marveled at how her daughter\u2019s curiosity seemed to mirror her own. At the shop, the warm, sweet aroma enveloped them, and Toni watched with delight as Amalie\u2019s eyes widened with wonder at the array of colorful doughnuts. As they settled into a cozy booth, their conversation naturally turned to the cosmos, a topic that had recently captivated Amalie, thanks to the kindness of a man named Marco. Toni felt a deep gratitude towards Marco, who had gifted Amalie a telescope, opening up a universe of exploration and learning for her inquisitive daughter. The generosity of his gesture had left a lasting impression on both mother and daughter, and Toni found herself reflecting on the impact of kindness and the importance of nurturing Amalie's burgeoning interests. In this moment, the doughnut shop became more than just a backdrop; it was a space where Toni and Amalie could celebrate not only the sweetness of their treats but also the sweetness of their bond. Toni felt a surge of ambition and protectiveness as she watched Amalie, who seemed so small yet so full of potential, a little girl with dreams as vast as the night sky. As they finished their breakfast and prepared to leave, Toni noticed a man trying to catch Amalie\u2019s attention. Without missing a beat, Amalie simply ignored him, her confidence and independence shining through. Toni felt a swell of pride, recognizing the strength and self-assurance her daughter was developing. It was a moment of reassurance for Toni, knowing that Amalie possessed the ability to navigate the world with poise and discernment. With a contented sigh, they returned to the car, the morning sun casting a golden hue over them. As they drove towards school, the radio played a familiar tune, and without hesitation, both mother and daughter began to sing along, their voices mingling in harmony. It was a simple yet profound moment, encapsulating the connection and contentment they shared. For Toni, these moments were invaluable, a reminder of the love and joy that formed the foundation of their life together. The drive became a journey of shared happiness, a testament to the bond they nurtured every single day.",

Not now. You look now.\u201d Toni felt strange. She\u2019d sneaked out like a teen-ager and come home different, out of joint, as if she\u2019d lost her virginity. \u201cI see a satellite,\u201d Amalie announced, but Toni\u2019s focus was earthbound. She was planning something in her head. She felt it all there, laid out. A structure she could borrow. A new sense of urgency. \u201cI see Mars.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, honey.\u201d He would be another set of eyes. He would keep an eye. The moment she decided, she decided everything. Where she\u2019d put her bureau, which room Amalie would get. Where Toni would set up a desk. Where she would try one more time. Slow down, she told herself, but then she thought, Why should I slow down? She had been too humble, too modest. The edges of the sky lightened. A seam appeared in the horizon, and they went inside. In the apartment, Amalie hugged Toni around the waist\u2014hugged her hard, encircling her totally, the way she had as a toddler. She made a move to return to bed, but Toni took her wrist and said no. \u201cNo?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s end the night in a doughnut shop.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the morning already!\u201d But that was what Toni wanted. Like in graduate school. Like the early-morning diner after the first time you\u2019ve been with someone. Coffee after a hookup. So that she could linger in this state, so that Amalie would remember it longer. They drove to the Christmas-themed doughnut shop off Exit 5 and Toni ordered half a dozen, what the hell, to celebrate. \u201cTo celebrate? What are we celebrating?\u201d They sat across from each other in a hard plastic yellow booth. On a shelf above them, several mechanical Santas were frozen in hip gyrations. \u201cYou!\u201d Toni said, lifting her coffee. The girl made a doubtful face, blinked her red-rimmed eyes. There was still a faint indentation around her eye socket, from the telescope. \u201cYou and the cosmos, honey. The sky. That\u2019s what.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Amalie said, taking a large bite. Toni allowed Amalie a few sips of coffee. Sugar granules sparkled on her cheeks. People came and went. Mostly old men. Toni said, \u201cWe should thank the man who gave you the telescope.\u201d \u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to him.\u201d \u201cI checked him out.\u201d \u201cYou did? When?\u201d An elderly man in a stained shirt and green-tinted glasses\u2014looking toward Amalie\u2014smiled and pressed a button on a Santa across the room, the tallest Santa, who began to gyrate and sing.

    "paragraph1": "As I followed Eli through the musty aisles of the library, the scent of old books and stale air filled my nostrils, and the soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead seemed to reverberate through my entire being. We had been working on our film project for months, and Eli, ever the networker, had insisted that we needed to get out and meet people, make connections, and get our names out there. I had reluctantly agreed, and so here we were, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispering patrons, on the hunt for someone, anyone, who might be able to help us break into the industry. That's when we saw him - Wagner, an older man with a commanding presence, sipping a drink from a flask and talking on his phone in hushed tones. He was a striking figure, with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy beard to match, and his eyes seemed to gleam with a knowing intensity that made me feel like an insect under a microscope. Nearby, an Amazonian woman with long, curly hair and a bright smile stood watching him, her eyes never leaving his face. Eli, undaunted by Wagner's formidable appearance, strode right up to him and introduced himself, explaining our film project and asking if he might be willing to offer some advice. At first, Wagner was dismissive, barely looking up from his phone as he muttered a few curt words, but Eli persisted, and eventually, Wagner's demeanor softened, and he began to engage with us. As we talked, I found myself drawn into Wagner's orbit, captivated by his world-weary cynicism and the way he seemed to see right through the fa\u00e7ade of the industry we were trying to break into. \"Don't care too much,\" he told us, his voice dripping with disdain. \"That's the secret to success. Don't get too attached, don't get too invested. Because the minute you do, someone will come along and rip it all away from you.\" Eli and I exchanged a skeptical glance, but Wagner just chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound, and continued, \"You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen it happen to the best of them. You want to make it in this business? Learn to not care.\" As he spoke, Sonia, the Amazonian woman, watched him with an intensity that bordered on devotion, and I found myself wondering what her story was, how she had ended up in Wagner's orbit. Wagner, seeming to sense my curiosity, smiled wryly and said, \"Sonia here knows all about pain. Real pain, not the fake stuff they peddle in the movies. She's been through hell and back, and she's still standing.\" Sonia's eyes never left Wagner's face, but I could sense a flicker of emotion behind them, a deep well of feeling that seemed to underscore Wagner's words. Eventually, Eli and I bid Wagner farewell, thanking him for his time and advice, and made our way out of the library, into the bright, cold sunlight. The encounter had left me feeling unsettled, unsure of what to make of Wagner's jaded perspective, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were just pawns in a much larger game. Later that night, at a New Year's Eve party, I found myself lost in thought, replaying the conversation with Wagner in my head. I had also been thinking about a conversation I had with Lily, a friend from college, about the futility of pursuing a romantic relationship. She had been going through a tough breakup, and I had",

We scrabbled through doors and rooms, and when we got to the library a voice said, \u201cCome in, come in,\u201d as if it had been expecting us. The voice belonged to a man of perhaps seventy-one, who was sitting low behind a desk, sipping from a snifter of what looked like corrupted urine and talking on a phone that for an instant I took to be a large kitten. It was such a striking sight that I almost missed the Amazonian woman standing to the side in a studded black leather bra and garters. I did a double take, but she didn\u2019t seem to register my gaze, just looked off glassily with impassive disgust and worked the tassels of her riding crop like a rosary. \u201cSatellite,\u201d Wagner told us, covering the mouthpiece with his hand.

Ten A.M.\u201d \u201cMustique,\u201d he said, putting the phone down. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to fly out tonight.\u201d \u201cFrank,\u201d Eli said, and took a few larger-than-normal steps toward Wagner and held out his hand, smiling as if they were old war buddies whom a comedy of errors had kept apart for years. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d Wagner said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I know you.\u201d Eli laughed his public laugh. \u201cEli. Eli Geller-Frucht,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the writer on the Hirschman film. \u2018Philosopher\u2019s Whetstone\u2019? Actually that title sucks, but Marley Jones at Buzzard told me her people talked to your people, she said you had a personal connection to the story\u2014tell me if I\u2019m making this up? Your wife\u2019s family? So we\u2019re thinking sort of a John Nash in \u2018The Good Shepherd\u2019 thing, but without all the schizophrenia, of course, and David\u2019s got this big fucking man-crush on Louis Malle, so we\u2019re doing kind of an \u2018Au Revoir les Enfants\u2019 open, very faithful to the spirit of Hirschman\u2019s story, you know, but\u2014\u201d Wagner held up a hand as though in some vague pain. \u201cYeah, yeah, I get it. I talked to David. Look, I\u2019m on board. I don\u2019t give a fuck about Hirschman, but my wife, Lydia, she won\u2019t shut up about \u2018Nana would have wanted to see her Albie as Zac Efron\u2019 or whatever. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous, but you get to the point of certain understandings\u201d\u2014Wagner inclined his head toward the half-dressed woman in the corner\u2014\u201cand, well, you get the picture.\u201d He put his hands on the desk and raised himself, and he must have been sitting in a comically small chair, because when he stood, far from being the wizened troll I had come to imagine, he loomed over both of us, six-four easy, with an elegant and gawky grace. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201cgive me some of that blow you\u2019re on and I\u2019ll let you in on a secret.\u201d Eli reached into his pocket without taking his eyes off Wagner and passed him the bag. The man looked at us like we had to be joking but then produced a two-inch piece of straw from the breast pocket of his jacket and snorted everything that was left, right from the plastic. He thumbed his nose and sniffed a few times, then gave a small shrug of disdain and settled, half sitting, on the front of the desk. \u201cThat coke sucks, but I\u2019ll tell you, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I was going to say: Stop giving so much of a shit.\u201d We blinked at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said. I love that you can ask people what they mean right after they\u2019ve said the most obvious things and almost invariably they\u2019ll assume that they are the ones who\u2019ve failed to be clear and go to elaborate lengths to make themselves understood. Wagner looked at me, then turned to Eli. \u201cYour friend\u2019s retarded,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I mean is\u2014look, if you care about something, like horses, go raise horses. Go ride them and fuck them or whatever people do with horses. Sell them to Arabs, I\u2019d guess. But if you\u2019re going to stay in this crappy business, and they\u2019re all crappy, stop giving a shit. Because you\u2019re here for one reason and you should know what that reason is. Do you?\u201d He looked from one of us to the other, then barked \u201cSonia!,\u201d and we jumped, but Sonia didn\u2019t. She just walked over and spanked us both insanely hard on the ass with her riding crop. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re here,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cis that you already have nice cars\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t, but I went along with the spirit of his admonition\u2014\u201cand girlfriends with that taut skin, and nice rentals in the hills\u2014or maybe you own?\u201d He looked at us doubtfully. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have the good stuff, do you, the really hard-to-come-by shit. You know what I\u2019m talking about: Envy. Serious, irrefutable reasons for people to envy you. And not just any sort of people, of course. You need people well informed enough to understand just how enviable you are. And people clever enough to know how to show their envy without being sycophants, and worldly enough to be charming company while they\u2019re envying you. . . . You need courtiers, see? Oh, they\u2019re better and worse than friends. They don\u2019t care about you, sure, but they understand the terms of your success far better than a friend ever could.

I love that you can ask people what they mean right after they\u2019ve said the most obvious things and almost invariably they\u2019ll assume that they are the ones who\u2019ve failed to be clear and go to elaborate lengths to make themselves understood. Wagner looked at me, then turned to Eli. \u201cYour friend\u2019s retarded,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I mean is\u2014look, if you care about something, like horses, go raise horses. Go ride them and fuck them or whatever people do with horses. Sell them to Arabs, I\u2019d guess. But if you\u2019re going to stay in this crappy business, and they\u2019re all crappy, stop giving a shit. Because you\u2019re here for one reason and you should know what that reason is. Do you?\u201d He looked from one of us to the other, then barked \u201cSonia!,\u201d and we jumped, but Sonia didn\u2019t. She just walked over and spanked us both insanely hard on the ass with her riding crop. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re here,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cis that you already have nice cars\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t, but I went along with the spirit of his admonition\u2014\u201cand girlfriends with that taut skin, and nice rentals in the hills\u2014or maybe you own?\u201d He looked at us doubtfully. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have the good stuff, do you, the really hard-to-come-by shit. You know what I\u2019m talking about: Envy. Serious, irrefutable reasons for people to envy you. And not just any sort of people, of course. You need people well informed enough to understand just how enviable you are. And people clever enough to know how to show their envy without being sycophants, and worldly enough to be charming company while they\u2019re envying you. . . . You need courtiers, see? Oh, they\u2019re better and worse than friends. They don\u2019t care about you, sure, but they understand the terms of your success far better than a friend ever could.

    "paragraph1": "Toni stood quietly in the dim light of the early morning, her mind a swirl of thoughts and possibilities as she contemplated the subtle yet profound changes she felt brewing in her life and home. There was a sense of urgency in her, a desire to seize the day and create meaningful moments with her daughter, Amalie. This morning felt different, charged with an energy that compelled Toni to shake up their routine. Inspired by her own cherished childhood memories, she decided to take Amalie to a doughnut shop before school, a place that held its own kind of magic. As they drove through the awakening city, Toni marveled at how her daughter\u2019s curiosity seemed to mirror her own. At the shop, the warm, sweet aroma enveloped them, and Toni watched with delight as Amalie\u2019s eyes widened with wonder at the array of colorful doughnuts. As they settled into a cozy booth, their conversation naturally turned to the cosmos, a topic that had recently captivated Amalie, thanks to the kindness of a man named Marco. Toni felt a deep gratitude towards Marco, who had gifted Amalie a telescope, opening up a universe of exploration and learning for her inquisitive daughter. The generosity of his gesture had left a lasting impression on both mother and daughter, and Toni found herself reflecting on the impact of kindness and the importance of nurturing Amalie's burgeoning interests. In this moment, the doughnut shop became more than just a backdrop; it was a space where Toni and Amalie could celebrate not only the sweetness of their treats but also the sweetness of their bond. Toni felt a surge of ambition and protectiveness as she watched Amalie, who seemed so small yet so full of potential, a little girl with dreams as vast as the night sky. As they finished their breakfast and prepared to leave, Toni noticed a man trying to catch Amalie\u2019s attention. Without missing a beat, Amalie simply ignored him, her confidence and independence shining through. Toni felt a swell of pride, recognizing the strength and self-assurance her daughter was developing. It was a moment of reassurance for Toni, knowing that Amalie possessed the ability to navigate the world with poise and discernment. With a contented sigh, they returned to the car, the morning sun casting a golden hue over them. As they drove towards school, the radio played a familiar tune, and without hesitation, both mother and daughter began to sing along, their voices mingling in harmony. It was a simple yet profound moment, encapsulating the connection and contentment they shared. For Toni, these moments were invaluable, a reminder of the love and joy that formed the foundation of their life together. The drive became a journey of shared happiness, a testament to the bond they nurtured every single day.",
    "paragraph2": "She was a polite kid, considerate\u2014she didn\u2019t forget Toni. \u201cYou want a turn?\u201d \u201cLater, honey. Not now. You look now.\u201d Toni felt strange. She\u2019d sneaked out like a teen-ager and come home different, out of joint, as if she\u2019d lost her virginity. \u201cI see a satellite,\u201d Amalie announced, but Toni\u2019s focus was earthbound. She was planning something in her head. She felt it all there, laid out. A structure she could borrow. A new sense of urgency. \u201cI see Mars.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, honey.\u201d He would be another set of eyes. He would keep an eye. The moment she decided, she decided everything. Where she\u2019d put her bureau, which room Amalie would get. Where Toni would set up a desk. Where she would try one more time. Slow down, she told herself, but then she thought, Why should I slow down? She had been too humble, too modest. The edges of the sky lightened. A seam appeared in the horizon, and they went inside. In the apartment, Amalie hugged Toni around the waist\u2014hugged her hard, encircling her totally, the way she had as a toddler. She made a move to return to bed, but Toni took her wrist and said no. \u201cNo?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s end the night in a doughnut shop.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the morning already!\u201d But that was what Toni wanted. Like in graduate school. Like the early-morning diner after the first time you\u2019ve been with someone. Coffee after a hookup. So that she could linger in this state, so that Amalie would remember it longer. They drove to the Christmas-themed doughnut shop off Exit 5 and Toni ordered half a dozen, what the hell, to celebrate. \u201cTo celebrate? What are we celebrating?\u201d They sat across from each other in a hard plastic yellow booth. On a shelf above them, several mechanical Santas were frozen in hip gyrations. \u201cYou!\u201d Toni said, lifting her coffee. The girl made a doubtful face, blinked her red-rimmed eyes. There was still a faint indentation around her eye socket, from the telescope. \u201cYou and the cosmos, honey. The sky. That\u2019s what.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d Amalie said, taking a large bite. Toni allowed Amalie a few sips of coffee. Sugar granules sparkled on her cheeks. People came and went. Mostly old men. Toni said, \u201cWe should thank the man who gave you the telescope.\u201d \u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to him.\u201d \u201cI checked him out.\u201d \u201cYou did? When?\u201d An elderly man in a stained shirt and green-tinted glasses\u2014looking toward Amalie\u2014smiled and pressed a button on a Santa across the room, the tallest Santa, who began to gyrate and sing. He was trying to please her, the only child in the place. Amalie winced like a woman with a hangover, looked out the window. The Santa crackled dementedly. Toni said, \u201cWe should give him a doughnut.\u201d \u201cHim?\u201d She thought Toni meant the man who started up the Santa. \u201cMarco.\u201d \u201cWait. Who\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cThe man who gave you the telescope. His name is Marco.\u201d Amalie stopped eating. She blinked her long lashes. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cIt would be nice.\u201d Amalie thought about it. \u201cA lemon,\u201d she said finally, looking into the box at the remaining doughnuts. Lemon were her least favorite. Then she tapped her watch, reminded her mother it was a school day. As they were leaving, she passed the man who had made the Santa dance, and he put his hand out, the way one does for a high five, a meaty palm, but Amalie sailed by, did not pause. Amalie my anomaly, her mother thought. Good girl. Just like that. In the parking lot, a big black bird tore at a garbage bag. Empty cans skidded across the pavement. A storm was coming, like Amalie had said. They were stuffed to the gills with sugar and caffeine. The school nurse would call in two hours. By that point, Toni would have called in sick herself, would be home napping. But before the nap. Before Amalie throws up in the coatroom. While the sky is so lovely and strange and their glucose levels have not yet plummeted\u2014she feels entitled to everything she wants. Ambition is ascendant. Danger everywhere, but it\u2019s not\u2014look at that\u2014in this story. In this story, no one lays a finger on any child. The wind lifts Amalie\u2019s hair. Toni lets her ride in the front seat.

He said that the desert was bare and lonesome and that it had hissed at him like a snake. He had walked for days and days, until the dunes broke apart beneath his feet, surging up around him to lash at his face, then everything went still and began to beat like a heart. The sound was as clear as any he had ever heard. It was only at that moment, he said, with a million arrow-points of sand striking his skin, that he had truly realized he was dead. Jim Singer, who managed the sandwich shop in the monument district, said that he had felt a prickling sensation in his fingers and then stopped breathing. \u201cIt was my heart,\u201d he insisted, thumping on his chest. \u201cTook me in my own bed.\u201d He had closed his eyes, and when he opened them again he was on a train, the kind that trolleys small children around in circles at amusement parks.

With nothing but the clothes on my back and a half-empty water bottle, I started walking. The first few hours felt liberating, each step taking me further from my problems. I had a lot of resolve when I started. But as my new situation settled on me and my hunger grew, I began to understand the severity of my predicament. I slept fitfully under a highway overpass, waking to the rumble of trucks above. The next day, thirst became my constant companion. I learned to scan the roadside for discarded bottles, grateful for even a few drops. A kind trucker shared his lunch on the third day, and I savored every bite of the slightly stale sandwich. By the fifth day, my feet were blistered and raw, each step a small agony. What I had done was patently insane. But I had always been a proud person, and this gave me the energy to keep moving. On the seventh day, I reached a small town and collapsed on a park bench. A local woman approached, concern etched on her face. She offered me a job at her diner, and with it, a chance to start over. I marveled at this stroke of luck. Was it possible that the very worst thing happening was just a portal to something better to come?\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "I first learned about R\u00e9gine through a series of peculiar circumstances that revolved around Denis, whom everyone referred to as \"the good Denis,\" and this encounter would ultimately reveal a complex web of emotions and unspoken histories that I never could have anticipated. The story unfolded gradually, with R\u00e9gine eventually sharing the profound impact Denis had on her life, but what she revealed next shook me to my core \u2013 Denis had harbored an intense, almost sacred love for me when I was a child, so much so that it had prevented him from having children with her, a fact that had caused her immense pain and resentment over the years. As she recounted her story, I could feel the weight of her words, heavy with years of suppressed emotions and unfulfilled dreams, all somehow connected to my unknowing presence in Denis's life. Her revelation was both touching and disturbing, painting a picture of Denis as a man whose capacity for love had somehow become fixated on a child \u2013 me \u2013 to the detriment of his adult relationships, particularly his relationship with R\u00e9gine. The complexity of her feelings was evident in how she spoke about Denis, mixing reverence for his saintly nature with the bitter acknowledgment of how his devotion to me had ultimately led to her own unhappiness. When I expressed a desire to meet her in person, perhaps hoping to bridge this unexpected gap between us or offer some form of reconciliation, she firmly rejected the idea, making it clear that she preferred to forget both Denis and her resentment towards me as an adult. Her rejection forced me to confront my own role in this complicated narrative, though I had been merely a child and unaware of the impact my presence had on their lives. As I reflected on this situation, I became acutely aware of my own lack of goodness, particularly in comparison to Denis's apparent saintliness, and I made the conscious decision not to seek R\u00e9gine's forgiveness, understanding that some wounds are better left untouched. This experience left me with a peculiar resolution: if I ever were to encounter Denis again, I would keep my knowledge of R\u00e9gine and her story buried deep within me, maintaining the silence that she so desperately sought. The whole situation had revealed layers of human complexity I hadn't expected to encounter \u2013 how one person's pure love could inadvertently cause another's suffering, how childhood innocence could unknowingly cast long shadows into adult lives, and how the past continues to shape our present in ways we can never fully understand. The story of R\u00e9gine, Denis, and my unwitting role in their narrative became a testament to the intricate ways in which human lives intersect and affect one another, often without our knowledge or consent, and how some relationships, despite their significance, are better left in the realm of memory rather than pursued into the present. This realization came with a certain melancholy, an understanding that sometimes the kindest action is to respect the distances that others choose to maintain, even when those distances are born from pain and resentment that we didn't intentionally cause. The entire experience left me with a profound appreciation for the complexity of human relationships and the way that love, even in its purest form, can sometimes lead to unexpected consequences that ripple through time, affecting lives in ways we could never predict or fully comprehend. The situation with R\u00e9gine and Denis had become a lesson in the delicate balance between understanding and action, between the desire to make amends and the wisdom to know when to step back, and ultimately, about the complicated nature of human",
    "paragraph2": "And then, miraculously, I made the acquaintance of R\u00e9gine. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d \u201cBy chance and persistence, which is to say that the tenacity I devoted not to finding you, exactly, since I had no idea you existed, but to following the trail of the good Denis led me to you, by accident, by fortune.\u201d \u201cYes, Denis. Why do you call him the good Denis?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how people speak of him to me. Is it not true?\u201d \u201cOh, it is, it is. Oh, yes, yes. The too good Denis, if you see what I mean, the excessively good Denis, perhaps, but, yes, he was good, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d \u201cOh, I am, I am. His goodness was like a thunderbolt, you see. No, I\u2019m wrong, his goodness was like the slow fire that descends from the heavens and settles over your soul and convinces you, numbs you, makes you feel you\u2019re nothing much but gives you hope that with meditation, integrity, and honor you may eventually become blessed yourself. You see, Denis, without knowing it or wanting it, was truly a saint. Like any saint, I suppose, he could be fearsome and terrifying in his greatness, that greatness of which he was unaware. Implacably rigorous in pursuing a goodness he clearly didn\u2019t register. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d \u201cMe? But, you understand, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d \u201cYou did, though, even if you were too young to remember. And what matters in all this is that he knew you well, he raised you, he cared for you like his own daughter, and he loved you the same way, happily, passionately. It was because of you that he refused to have a child with me, out of a monstrously virtuous fidelity to his memory of that tiny girl, you. \u2018I can\u2019t let another child into my memory,\u2019 he would tell me. \u2018I can\u2019t think of creating any competition between my memory of Mimi and the memory I might have of another little girl.\u2019 And I answered, \u2018But what makes you think you\u2019d lose our child, too?\u2019 And he said, \u2018It happens. I owe it to Mimi to forever think of her as the only child I ever loved.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not dead!\u201d \u201cHe lost you\u2014it\u2019s the same thing. As I understand it, your mother took you away one day, left him just like that, and of course you went with her. Denis\u2019s glorious simplicity shielded him from hard feelings, and even from pointless anguish, from vainly protracted grief. He endured his lot with a smile. And, at the same time, he resolved to remain forever the father of only one child, you. Oh, not, as you must already understand, to spare himself other sorrows. He never gave that a thought. He had no fear of sorrow, and he didn\u2019t wallow in it. It\u2019s just that the inexorable, unyielding nature of his marvellous humanity had led him to decide that because he\u2019d loved you desperately, and because you\u2019d been taken away from him without your wanting it at all, he owed it to you never to attach himself to any other child, ever.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! It\u2019s absurd!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. That was Denis. That was why I left him. I went on to have the children I wanted, of course, with other men. But I miss the child Denis and I would have had, so I can\u2019t help resenting you a little. Forgive me, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The strange damage that goodness can do! When I asked R\u00e9gine how she felt about my wish to meet in person, she seemed surprised and shocked, as if I were proposing something utterly immoral. \u201cWhat reason would I have for meeting you? The adult that you are has no place in my life, you don\u2019t interest me. And also I want to forget the good Denis\u2014I\u2019ve been working on that all this time. Meet you? Who do you think you are? How indecent! You do not interest me, Madame. To me, Madame, you are only the faded reflection of a child who caused my unhappiness. I couldn\u2019t hate the little girl Denis so loved that he couldn\u2019t imagine giving the smallest share of his unlimited tenderness to any other, even his own\u2014I couldn\u2019t hate her, because you can\u2019t hate a child.

    "text_input": "You are given two pararaphs of writing for a given instruction.\nYour task is to determine which paragraph is overall better in terms of writing quality.\n\nParagraph 1:\nI first learned about R\u00e9gine through a series of peculiar circumstances that revolved around Denis, whom everyone referred to as \"the good Denis,\" and this encounter would ultimately reveal a complex web of emotions and unspoken histories that I never could have anticipated. The story unfolded gradually, with R\u00e9gine eventually sharing the profound impact Denis had on her life, but what she revealed next shook me to my core \u2013 Denis had harbored an intense, almost sacred love for me when I was a child, so much so that it had prevented him from having children with her, a fact that had caused her immense pain and resentment over the years. As she recounted her story, I could feel the weight of her words, heavy with years of suppressed emotions and unfulfilled dreams, all somehow connected to my unknowing presence in Denis's life. Her revelation was both touching and disturbing, painting a picture of Denis as a man whose capacity for love had somehow become fixated on a child \u2013 me \u2013 to the detriment of his adult relationships, particularly his relationship with R\u00e9gine. The complexity of her feelings was evident in how she spoke about Denis, mixing reverence for his saintly nature with the bitter acknowledgment of how his devotion to me had ultimately led to her own unhappiness. When I expressed a desire to meet her in person, perhaps hoping to bridge this unexpected gap between us or offer some form of reconciliation, she firmly rejected the idea, making it clear that she preferred to forget both Denis and her resentment towards me as an adult. Her rejection forced me to confront my own role in this complicated narrative, though I had been merely a child and unaware of the impact my presence had on their lives. As I reflected on this situation, I became acutely aware of my own lack of goodness, particularly in comparison to Denis's apparent saintliness, and I made the conscious decision not to seek R\u00e9gine's forgiveness, understanding that some wounds are better left untouched. This experience left me with a peculiar resolution: if I ever were to encounter Denis again, I would keep my knowledge of R\u00e9gine and her story buried deep within me, maintaining the silence that she so desperately sought. The whole situation had revealed layers of human complexity I hadn't expected to encounter \u2013 how one person's pure love could inadvertently cause another's suffering, how childhood innocence could unknowingly cast long shadows into adult lives, and how the past continues to shape our present in ways we can never fully understand. The story of R\u00e9gine, Denis, and my unwitting role in their narrative became a testament to the intricate ways in which human lives intersect and affect one another, often without our knowledge or consent, and how some relationships, despite their significance, are better left in the realm of memory rather than pursued into the present. This realization came with a certain melancholy, an understanding that sometimes the kindest action is to respect the distances that others choose to maintain, even when those distances are born from pain and resentment that we didn't intentionally cause. The entire experience left me with a profound appreciation for the complexity of human relationships and the way that love, even in its purest form, can sometimes lead to unexpected consequences that ripple through time, affecting lives in ways we could never predict or fully comprehend. The situation with R\u00e9gine and Denis had become a lesson in the delicate balance between understanding and action, between the desire to make amends and the wisdom to know when to step back, and ultimately, about the complicated nature of human\n\nParagraph 2:\nAnd then, miraculously, I made the acquaintance of R\u00e9gine. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d \u201cBy chance and persistence, which is to say that the tenacity I devoted not to finding you, exactly, since I had no idea you existed, but to following the trail of the good Denis led me to you, by accident, by fortune.\u201d \u201cYes, Denis. Why do you call him the good Denis?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how people speak of him to me. Is it not true?\u201d \u201cOh, it is, it is. Oh, yes, yes. The too good Denis, if you see what I mean, the excessively good Denis, perhaps, but, yes, he was good, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d \u201cOh, I am, I am. His goodness was like a thunderbolt, you see. No, I\u2019m wrong, his goodness was like the slow fire that descends from the heavens and settles over your soul and convinces you, numbs you, makes you feel you\u2019re nothing much but gives you hope that with meditation, integrity, and honor you may eventually become blessed yourself. You see, Denis, without knowing it or wanting it, was truly a saint. Like any saint, I suppose, he could be fearsome and terrifying in his greatness, that greatness of which he was unaware. Implacably rigorous in pursuing a goodness he clearly didn\u2019t register. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d \u201cMe? But, you understand, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d \u201cYou did, though, even if you were too young to remember. And what matters in all this is that he knew you well, he raised you, he cared for you like his own daughter, and he loved you the same way, happily, passionately. It was because of you that he refused to have a child with me, out of a monstrously virtuous fidelity to his memory of that tiny girl, you. \u2018I can\u2019t let another child into my memory,\u2019 he would tell me. \u2018I can\u2019t think of creating any competition between my memory of Mimi and the memory I might have of another little girl.\u2019 And I answered, \u2018But what makes you think you\u2019d lose our child, too?\u2019 And he said, \u2018It happens. I owe it to Mimi to forever think of her as the only child I ever loved.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not dead!\u201d \u201cHe lost you\u2014it\u2019s the same thing. As I understand it, your mother took you away one day, left him just like that, and of course you went with her. Denis\u2019s glorious simplicity shielded him from hard feelings, and even from pointless anguish, from vainly protracted grief. He endured his lot with a smile. And, at the same time, he resolved to remain forever the father of only one child, you. Oh, not, as you must already understand, to spare himself other sorrows. He never gave that a thought. He had no fear of sorrow, and he didn\u2019t wallow in it. It\u2019s just that the inexorable, unyielding nature of his marvellous humanity had led him to decide that because he\u2019d loved you desperately, and because you\u2019d been taken away from him without your wanting it at all, he owed it to you never to attach himself to any other child, ever.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! It\u2019s absurd!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. That was Denis. That was why I left him. I went on to have the children I wanted, of course, with other men. But I miss the child Denis and I would have had, so I can\u2019t help resenting you a little. Forgive me, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The strange damage that goodness can do! When I asked R\u00e9gine how she felt about my wish to meet in person, she seemed surprised and shocked, as if I were proposing something utterly immoral. \u201cWhat reason would I have for meeting you? The adult that you are has no place in my life, you don\u2019t interest me. And also I want to forget the good Denis\u2014I\u2019ve been working on that all this time. Meet you? Who do you think you are? How indecent! You do not interest me, Madame. To me, Madame, you are only the faded reflection of a child who caused my unhappiness. I couldn\u2019t hate the little girl Denis so loved that he couldn\u2019t imagine giving the smallest share of his unlimited tenderness to any other, even his own\u2014I couldn\u2019t hate her, because you can\u2019t hate a child. But the woman you\u2019ve become I can only resent, however unfair that may be.\u201d Although it was hard, I decided not to ask for R\u00e9gine\u2019s forgiveness. I asked only if she knew where the good Denis lived. \u201cI do not, and I have no wish to. I\u2019m not good.

She went to stand over Jane, wanted to mash her foot in her mother\u2019s face. \u201cGet from over me,\u201d Jane snapped. What the fuck was Jane mad about? She wasn\u2019t the one who had been assaulted. Theo\u2019s welts tightened and released, but the pain was interesting, not overwhelming. The worst was on her shoulder, where the skin was raw.

However, her mother, Jane, had firmly and repeatedly opposed such an arrangement, citing reasons that Theo could not fully comprehend.

Shirlee, eager to support her friend, slipped over to Theo's house under the cover of darkness. They had scarcely begun to enjoy each other's company when Jane, her bath abruptly concluded, discovered their clandestine meeting. Her anger was a force of nature, crashing into the room with a fury that left Theo breathless. Jane's confrontation with Theo was intense, her eyes blazing with a mix of betrayal and disapproval, and it quickly escalated into a physical altercation. In a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity, Jane grabbed an extension cord, wielding it with the intent to discipline, a symbol of her need to control and dominate. The blows rained down on Theo, each one stinging with pain and the weight of unspoken words. Yet, through the haze of pain and adrenaline, Theo resisted, refusing to submit to the authority that sought to break her spirit. In the struggle, Theo managed to sidestep Jane's aggression, causing her to stumble and fall, a brief triumph that left Theo breathless and guilt-ridden. The tension between Theo and her mother was as palpable as the air they breathed, a constant reminder of the chasm that had grown between them. Jane, in her anger, voiced her disapproval of Theo's friendship with Shirlee, lacing her words with derogatory comments that cut deeper than any physical blow.

She reflected on the situation, her thoughts a turbulent sea of emotions, a mixture of defiance and a desperate yearning for independence.

The paragraph captured the strained relationship between Theo and Jane, a dynamic fraught with unspoken tensions and unfulfilled desires, highlighting themes of control and rebellion, as Theo struggled to assert her identity in a world that seemed determined to stifle it. Through the chaos of the evening, Theo realized that her journey towards independence would be fraught with challenges, but it was a path she was determined to walk, with or without her mother's approval.

    "paragraph1": "Thumbing through my old address book feels like excavating artifacts from another life\u2014one filled with cocktail parties, gallery openings, and endless social obligations that now seem like scenes from someone else's movie. The irony isn't lost on me as I sit here, compiling names for Dr. Chacko's flyer distribution, imagining my former acquaintances' perfectly manicured hands tossing it into their recycling bins without a second glance. These same people who once hung on my every word at dinner parties would now likely dismiss this as just another piece of junk mail, wedged between grocery store circulars and credit card offers. The manuscript sitting on my desk remains stubbornly cryptic, its dense passages refusing to yield their secrets, which seems at odds with my mental image of Dr. Chacko\u2014relaxed, approachable, nothing like the complexity of these written words. After meticulously assembling the list of names, I feel almost like a conspiracy theorist as I make my way to Dr. Chacko's cottage, the envelope containing my carefully curated contacts feeling oddly weighted in my hands. The empty cottage stands as a silent witness to my furtive mission, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm participating in something clandestine as I slip the envelope through the mail slot. When Betty appears at my door the next morning, her face etched with an uncharacteristic gravity and my list clutched in her hand, I realize that my simple act of compilation has set something in motion that I hadn't anticipated, something that makes me question the wisdom of bridging these two worlds\u2014my past and my present.",
    "paragraph2": "This request made, the girls went to deliver their little cooked dishes before they grew cold. I took out my old address book, which was full of names I had expected never to need again. And when I saw those names and thought of the life I had lived for so many years\u2014the fund-raiser banquets in hotel ballrooms, the catered dinners, and the ladies\u2019 lunches\u2014and then looked at the handbill designed on Maeve\u2019s computer, with a passport-like photograph of Dr. Chacko, I was struck by the incompatibility of that past with this present. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t help being amused by the idea of those people\u2014or their social secretaries\u2014receiving this flyer, and discarding it in the wastebasket, along with all the other crazy mail. And, if they were actually to read the text, what would they make of it? No more than I could. Here I stopped transcribing names to leaf through the manuscript itself, in the hope of gaining some glimmer of understanding. There was none; it remained turgid and incomprehensible to me and in no way reflected the man I had seen lying indolently under a tree. I put the list in an envelope with a note to say that I hoped it would be useful to him. I knocked on his door and, receiving no answer, pushed it open. The cottage was empty, not only of him but of any presence whatsoever: there was nothing except my abandoned furniture and the fan I had given him\u2014no photographs, no pictures, nothing personal.

The irony isn't lost on me as I sit here, compiling names for Dr. Chacko's flyer distribution, imagining my former acquaintances' perfectly manicured hands tossing it into their recycling bins without a second glance. These same people who once hung on my every word at dinner parties would now likely dismiss this as just another piece of junk mail, wedged between grocery store circulars and credit card offers. The manuscript sitting on my desk remains stubbornly cryptic, its dense passages refusing to yield their secrets, which seems at odds with my mental image of Dr. Chacko\u2014relaxed, approachable, nothing like the complexity of these written words. After meticulously assembling the list of names, I feel almost like a conspiracy theorist as I make my way to Dr. Chacko's cottage, the envelope containing my carefully curated contacts feeling oddly weighted in my hands. The empty cottage stands as a silent witness to my furtive mission, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm participating in something clandestine as I slip the envelope through the mail slot. When Betty appears at my door the next morning, her face etched with an uncharacteristic gravity and my list clutched in her hand, I realize that my simple act of compilation has set something in motion that I hadn't anticipated, something that makes me question the wisdom of bridging these two worlds\u2014my past and my present.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThis request made, the girls went to deliver their little cooked dishes before they grew cold. I took out my old address book, which was full of names I had expected never to need again. And when I saw those names and thought of the life I had lived for so many years\u2014the fund-raiser banquets in hotel ballrooms, the catered dinners, and the ladies\u2019 lunches\u2014and then looked at the handbill designed on Maeve\u2019s computer, with a passport-like photograph of Dr. Chacko, I was struck by the incompatibility of that past with this present. At the same time, I couldn\u2019t help being amused by the idea of those people\u2014or their social secretaries\u2014receiving this flyer, and discarding it in the wastebasket, along with all the other crazy mail. And, if they were actually to read the text, what would they make of it? No more than I could. Here I stopped transcribing names to leaf through the manuscript itself, in the hope of gaining some glimmer of understanding. There was none; it remained turgid and incomprehensible to me and in no way reflected the man I had seen lying indolently under a tree. I put the list in an envelope with a note to say that I hoped it would be useful to him. I knocked on his door and, receiving no answer, pushed it open. The cottage was empty, not only of him but of any presence whatsoever: there was nothing except my abandoned furniture and the fan I had given him\u2014no photographs, no pictures, nothing personal. I put the envelope on the table and left quickly, as though I were doing something underhanded. My instinct turned out to be correct: the next day, Betty came to see me, looking grave and holding the list in her hand.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The tragic loss of both mother and daughter, though strangers to her, served as a stark reminder of life's unpredictability and forced her to question the assumptions she had held about the natural progression of things. In this state of emotional turbulence, her mind wandered to a long-buried memory from her childhood, one that now seemed to carry newfound significance. She could still picture that warm evening when, walking alongside her grandfather, they encountered a woman with her two daughters. The scene unfolded in her mind with remarkable clarity: she and the older sister, who was exactly her age, became instant playmates, their laughter echoing through the evening air as they took turns pushing the younger sister in a bamboo stroller. Jiayu remembered with particular fondness how she had proudly shown off her transistor radio, transforming its antenna into an imaginary fishing pole in their makeshift game. The details remained vivid even now \u2013 the identical pot-lid haircuts of the sisters that was so common during that era, and her own beloved yellow dress adorned with cheerful sunflowers that she had worn that evening. This memory, previously just one of many childhood recollections, now seemed to carry a poignant weight as she contemplated how quickly life could change, how moments of connection and joy could become precious artifacts of a time that could never be reclaimed.",

This so startled Jiayu that she thought her heart, already brittle, could no longer remain a steady organ inside her. For days afterward, she lived in a trance, fearing the inaccuracies of memory, excavating the archeology of her childhood, the fragments like small pieces of bone, delicate and dusty. It was on one of their evening walks that Jiayu and her grandfather had met the woman and her two daughters, the older one Jiayu\u2019s age, the younger one still in a bamboo stroller. That there had been two girls Jiayu was certain. And that there had been a bamboo stroller. She and the other girl took turns pushing it around while Jiayu\u2019s grandfather and the girls\u2019 mother sat on a bench nearby.

The girl who was to be her playmate for a few weeks asked to see the radio, and Jiayu showed her the on-and-off switch, the dials for changing the frequency and the volume, and the collapsible antenna, which they pulled out and pretended was a fishing pole. The girl in the stroller, who, in their play, was the fish to be caught, held her hands up and cried, but they kept the end of the antenna just out of her reach.

When she moved in here, when she chose this life with Clark, she began to see things in a new way. After that, it was only the mobile homes that she really looked at, to see how people had fixed them up\u2014the kind of curtains they had hung, the way they had painted the trim, the ambitious decks or patios or extra rooms they had built on. She could hardly wait to get to such improvements herself. Clark had gone along with her ideas for a while. He had built new steps, and spent a lot of time looking for an old wrought-iron railing for them. He hadn\u2019t complained about the money spent on paint for the kitchen and bathroom or the material for curtains. What he did balk at was tearing up the carpet, which was the same in every room and the thing that she had most counted on replacing. It was divided into small brown squares, each with a pattern of darker brown, rust, and tan squiggles and shapes. For a long time, she had thought that the same squiggles and shapes were arranged the same way in each square. Then, when she had had more time, a lot of time, to examine them, she decided that there were four patterns joined together to make identical larger squares. Sometimes she could pick out the arrangement easily and sometimes she had to work to see it. She did this at times when Clark\u2019s mood had weighted down all their indoor space. The best thing then was to invent or remember some job to do in the barn. The horses would not look at her when she was unhappy, but Flora, who was never tied up, would come and rub against her, and look up with an expression that was not quite sympathy; it was more like comradely mockery in her shimmering yellow-green eyes.",

When Luda first married into the family, Nadia's elaborate, traditional dishes intimidated her. Luda's own cooking skills were limited to simple, comforting meals, and she felt like a novice in Nadia's shadow. However, as she began to help Nadia in the kitchen, she discovered a deep appreciation for the stories and history behind each recipe. Nadia's passion for cooking was contagious, and Luda found herself experimenting with new flavors and techniques. But as time passed, Luda's growing confidence in the kitchen was met with Nadia's subtle criticism and unsolicited advice. Luda started to feel like she was in a perpetual competition, always trying to impress Nadia without ever quite measuring up. This tension seeped into her cooking, making her dishes more precise, more calculated, but also more sterile. She began to lose touch with the joy and spontaneity that had initially drawn her to cooking. It wasn't until she started hosting her own dinner parties, away from Nadia's watchful eye, that Luda rediscovered her love for food as a means of connection and community. Her dishes became more intuitive, more expressive, and more reflective of her own identity. As she found her own voice in the kitchen, Luda's relationship with Nadia evolved, too.

He crossed the high-ceilinged entrance hall and stepped through the dining room\u2019s open doorway. The food was laid out on a large oval table. There were five chairs, but no sign of people. White wisps of steam rose from the serving plates. A glass vase bearing a dozen lilies occupied the center of the table. Four places were set with napkins and cutlery, untouched, by the look of it. It seemed as though people had been sitting down to eat their breakfast a few minutes earlier, when some sudden and unforeseen event sent them all running off. What had happened? Where had they gone? Or where had they been taken? Would they return to eat their breakfast? But Samsa had no time to ponder such questions. Falling into the nearest chair, he grabbed whatever food he could reach with his bare hands and stuffed it into his mouth, quite ignoring the knives, spoons, forks, and napkins. He tore bread into pieces and downed it without jam or butter, gobbled fat boiled sausages whole, devoured hard-boiled eggs with such speed that he almost forgot to peel them, scooped up handfuls of still warm mashed potatoes, and plucked pickles with his fingers. He chewed it all together, and washed the remnants down with water from a jug. Taste was of no consequence. Bland or delicious, spicy or sour\u2014it was all the same to him. All that mattered was filling that empty cavern inside him. He ate with total concentration, as if racing against time. He was so fixated on eating that once, as he was licking his fingers, he sank his teeth into them by mistake. Scraps of food flew everywhere, and when a platter fell to the floor and smashed he paid no attention whatsoever. By the time Samsa had eaten his fill and sat back to catch his breath, almost nothing was left, and the dining table was an awful sight. It looked as if a flock of quarrelsome crows had flown in through an open window, gorged themselves, and flown away again. The only thing untouched was the vase of lilies; had there been less food, he might have devoured them as well.",
    "paragraph2": "Samsa's trembling legs carried him down the final steps of the staircase, his entire being drawn inexorably toward the tantalizing aroma wafting from the dining room. His stomach twisted with a hunger so profound it had long since transformed from mere discomfort into an all-consuming agony. As he crossed the threshold, the sight before him was almost surreal: a fully laden table, dishes arranged with careful precision, steam still rising from various platters, yet not a soul in attendance. The empty chairs seemed to mock him, but his desperate state left no room for social niceties or questioning the strange circumstances. Without hesitation, he lunged forward, his hands grabbing at everything within reach. Utensils lay forgotten as he tore into bread, meat, and vegetables with animal-like intensity, barely registering the tastes or textures. Food disappeared into his mouth in great handfuls, sauce and gravy dripping down his chin and onto the pristine tablecloth. In his frenzy, he barely noticed when his teeth clamped down on his own fingers, the pain registering only as a distant sensation compared to the overwhelming need to fill his hollow stomach. Dishes clattered and toppled as his desperate feast continued, spilling their contents across the once-immaculate table setting. Wine glasses teetered and fell, their contents creating dark pools that spread across the white linen like spilled blood. Through it all, only the vase of lilies at the center of the table remained untouched, standing as a silent witness to his savage meal. When at last his hunger began to subside, Samsa found himself surrounded by the carnage of his desperate feeding: overturned plates, scattered food, and stained linens creating a tableau of chaos that bore little resemblance to the carefully arranged setting he had encountered. The elegant dining room had been transformed into something that looked more like the aftermath of a wild animal's feast, with only those pure white lilies maintaining their dignity amidst the destruction.",

It wasn\u2019t the most thrilling job she could imagine, but she did have some responsibility, and over all it wasn\u2019t so bad. Whenever the salesmen were out she took over, and she always did a decent job of answering the customers\u2019 questions. She had watched the salesmen at work, and quickly grasped the necessary technical information. She\u2019d memorized the mileage ratings of all the models in the showroom and could convince anyone, for instance, that the Odyssey handled less like a minivan than like an ordinary sedan. Mizuki was a good conversationalist, and she had a winning smile that always put customers at ease. She also knew how to subtly change tacks, based on her reading of each customer\u2019s personality. Unfortunately, however, she didn\u2019t have the authority to give discounts, to negotiate trade-ins, or to throw in free options, so, even if she had the customer ready to sign on the dotted line, in the end she had to turn things over to one of the salesmen, who would get the commission. The only reward she could expect was a free dinner now and then from a salesman sharing his windfall. Occasionally it crossed her mind that the dealership would sell more cars if it would let her do sales. But the idea didn\u2019t occur to anyone else. That\u2019s the way a company operates: the sales division is one thing, the clerical staff another, and, except in very rare cases, those boundaries are unbreachable.",

Having secured her position through her uncle, a Honda executive, after graduating from a women's junior college in Tokyo, she finds herself immersed in the intricacies of the automotive world. While her job lacks the thrill she once envisioned, Mizuki derives a subtle satisfaction from her daily responsibilities, particularly when stepping in for the salesmen to field customer inquiries. Her knack for understanding the technical nuances of vehicles, like the mileage ratings and features of models such as the Odyssey, enhances her ability to engage persuasively with customers. Her conversational skills and adaptability to various customer personalities make her an invaluable asset to the dealership. Despite her effectiveness, Mizuki's role is limited; she lacks the authority to close deals, a task reserved for the salesmen who reap the commissions. This hierarchical structure occasionally frustrates Mizuki, especially when her efforts culminate in nothing more than a free dinner as a token of appreciation from a grateful salesman. She often reflects on how the dealership might benefit from allowing her to handle sales directly, but the rigid separation between clerical and sales roles remains a barrier to her advancement. Nonetheless, Mizuki continues to perform her duties with dedication, holding onto the hope that her contributions will eventually be recognized, and that the dealership's structure may one day evolve to accommodate her aspirations.",

Most of the living-room furniture had been moved to the basement, and extra tables joined to the main one to form a giant U. They were covered with tablecloths, set with white plates and silverware, and had centerpieces of gourds. I was struck by the toys and dolls that were everywhere, dogs that shed long yellow hairs on everything, all the photographs of Bonny and Sara and Deborah decorating the walls, still more plastering the refrigerator door.

Deborah\u2019s family, whom we remembered dimly from the wedding, was there, her parents and her brothers and sisters and their husbands and wives and boyfriends and babies. Her sisters were in their thirties, but, like Deborah, they could have been mistaken for college students, wearing jeans and clogs and fisherman sweaters, and her brother Matty, with whom I had danced in a circle at the wedding, was now a freshman at Amherst, with wide-set green eyes and wispy brown hair and a complexion that reddened easily. As soon as I saw Deborah\u2019s siblings, joking with one another as they chopped and stirred things in the kitchen, I was furious with my mother for making a scene before we left the house and forcing me to wear a shalwar kameez. I knew they assumed, from my clothing, that I had more in common with the other Bengalis than with them. But Deborah insisted on including me, setting me to work peeling apples with Matty, and out of my parents\u2019 sight I was given beer to drink. When the meal was ready, we were told where to sit, in an alternating boy-girl formation that made the Bengalis uncomfortable. Bottles of wine were lined up on the table. Two turkeys were brought out, one stuffed with sausage and one without. My mouth watered at the food, but I knew that afterward, on our way home, my mother would complain that it was all tasteless and bland. \u201cImpossible,\u201d my mother said, shaking her hand over the top of her glass when someone tried to pour her a little wine. Deborah\u2019s father, Gene, got up to say grace, and asked everyone at the table to join hands.

Scraps of food flew everywhere, and when a platter fell to the floor and smashed he paid no attention whatsoever.

    "paragraph1": "When I was a child, somebody gave me a paperweight that contained within it an impossibly detailed forest scene, and when I think of the grapes, of how all the complexity of our family became enfolded in the grapes, I imagine that if I had lifted one of those grapes up to the light and rotated it around I would have perceived within it all of our family histories depicted in miniature, not just me and Inma in our own high chairs at the dawn of the eighties, our parents feeding us, but our own parents being fed in the forties and fifties, all the way back to our respective Old Worlds, Kyiv and San Juan, kasha or plantains, however mouths were sated and policed according to family and cultural custom, and if I kept rotating the grape I\u2019d also see Mrs. Sackett wielding her pencil of life and Mr. Kessler telling us not to practice our thrusts, all of it as intricately rendered as the shield of Achilles, or Zeuxis\u2019 grapes, which were so perfectly represented in his paintings that birds tried to eat them, birds, which sing from their syrinx, not their larynx, and cannot to my knowledge choke to death, although some can mimic human speech. When I was in charge of preparing Astra\u2019s food, I chopped everything so finely I admit I might as well have blended it or hit it with a hammer, which is not what I was supposed to be doing, I was supposed to be giving her an experience of texture, as Inma kept pointing out\u2014\u201cShe has to learn what she likes; she has to learn to use her teeth\u201d\u2014and since Inma\u2019s mother was over many times a week she often witnessed Inma remarking that I\u2019d inadvertently liquefied Astra\u2019s food, and of course Inma\u2019s mom silently sided with Inma, forming a triangle; I was the neurotic cracker with no experience caring for children who was trying to micromanage the steamed carrots, the hot dogs (which, thankfully, Astra didn\u2019t really like), and the grapes. Because Inma\u2019s mom had taught kindergarten (she\u2019d recently retired), I\u2019d hoped she might share the intensity of my concern about Astra choking\u2014surely there had been trainings about these things\u2014but although both Inma and her mother were incredibly conscientious caretakers in general, so graceful and competent with Astra that I felt bumbling in comparison, and although they watched her closely when she ate, the fear of her choking quickly became my thing, the worry I carried that carried all of my other worries: I would pulverize the food and they would not quite slice it properly, which is the way of polarization. When Inma\u2019s mom was sitting with Astra at the table, it was less that I watched over them than that my effort not to was palpable, and if Inma or her mom was cutting something for Astra I perceived a slight exaggeration in their gestures, a trace of performativity that said, See how tiny these pieces are? Do we have your permission to feed her? It was a clich\u00e9, this tension around the child\u2019s eating, the triangulation, etc., but I was finding small, mortally uncut grapes in the purple plastic snack container Inma\u2019s mom took with Astra to the park, and large grapes on the high chair that were cut in half but never lengthwise (anyway, they should be quartered), and then I\u2019d confront Inma about it, as if it were her fault, demanding she talk to her mom, and before we knew it we would be having a spectacular fight, scaling up from the grapes to questions of power, labor, value, the possibility of love, Astra crying when we yelled (or, worse, taking it all in silently, blinking her large brown eyes). We\u2019d had one such fight only a month or two before I choked. And it was only when I choked, while I was standing there choking at Caf\u00e9 Loup, that I fully realized (although not in these words) that our polarization around the grapes issued from our conflicting but, in fact, equally magical beliefs about the effects of my voicing, again and again, my fear of Astra choking. Inma would of course agree that the food should be cut up, but the intensity of my focus on this particular risk, the repetitive articulation of my concerns\u2014reading statistics off my phone (\u201cLast year alone, every child in America choked to death\u201d), showing with my thumb and index finger the tiny diameter of a child\u2019s windpipe\u2014was, in Inma\u2019s mind, courting disaster. This was both because talking about it at all invited the evil in and because too much confidence in \u201crisk management,\u201d the financialized world view of the privileged, was a kind of hubris, the fantasy that you could halve or quarter the constant threats that attended living; it was asking God, or whatever cosmic force, to cut you lengthwise down to size. Inma, then, did not speak her fears, for fear that speaking them would make them happen (that speaking them would summon one of those little tornadoes of debris); she did not, while pregnant with Astra, ever acknowledge her terror of another late miscarriage, for instance, neither to me nor, I\u2019m sure, to her mother, whereas I told my own mother constantly that the pregnan",
    "paragraph2": "I often find myself lost in thoughts about my family's history, a rich tapestry interwoven with stories and symbols that have shaped who I am today. One particular memory stands out vividly\u2014receiving a small, unassuming paperweight as a child. At first glance, it seemed like a simple object, but for me, it represented much more. It was a metaphor for the complex and intricate history of my family, a history that I have spent countless hours contemplating. I often liken our family history to grapes, each grape representing a story, a life, a moment in time that has contributed to the vast vineyard of our shared past. This metaphorical vineyard is both beautiful and burdensome, as it carries the weight of generations of love, struggle, and resilience. Nowadays, my reflections on family history are often intertwined with my anxieties about my child, Astra. I find myself consumed by an obsessive fear that Astra might choke on food\u2014a fear that has taken root deep within me and grown into a pervasive worry that I cannot seem to shake. This fear has become a point of tension between my partner, Inma, and me, as well as with Inma's mother, who frequently sides with Inma in our disagreements. Inma and I have different approaches to parenting, and my anxiety over Astra choking often leads to arguments that seem to encompass broader issues of power and love within our relationship. Inma believes that I am overly cautious and that my fears are unfounded, while I feel that my concerns are valid and that I am simply trying to protect our child. This conflict is further complicated by the involvement of Inma's mother, whose opinions often add fuel to the fire. She seems to view my concerns as an overreaction, aligning herself with Inma's more relaxed approach. In these moments, I feel isolated and misunderstood, my fears dismissed as irrational. However, my anxiety is very real to me, and it manifests in various ways, from meticulously cutting Astra's food into tiny, manageable pieces to constantly watching for any signs of distress while she eats. It's as though my fear of choking has become a focal point of my life, a lens through which I view my role as a parent and protector. This fear has caused me to question my abilities and has led to moments of self-doubt and insecurity. Despite the tension it creates, I cannot simply ignore what feels like an ever-present danger. Then, one day, I found myself in a situation that forced me to confront my own fears in a very personal way. I was enjoying a meal when, suddenly, I began to choke. In those terrifying moments, I realized how fragile life truly is and how easily the unexpected can occur. As I struggled to breathe, it dawned on me that my fear of Astra choking was not just about the act itself but about the vulnerability and lack of control that it represented. This incident served as a catalyst for introspection and self-awareness, prompting me to reconsider the dynamics at play in my relationship with Inma. I began to see that our differing beliefs about voicing fears were at the heart of many of our conflicts. Inma tends to approach life with a sense of optimism and trust, believing that voicing fears gives them power and life. In contrast, I have always felt that expressing my fears is a way to confront and manage them, to prepare for the worst so that I am not caught off guard. Our opposing viewpoints have led to misunderstandings and arguments, each of us convinced that our way is the right way. Through this experience, I realized that perhaps there is no right or wrong way, but rather a need for balance and understanding. I understood that my fear, while valid, should not overshadow the joy and spontaneity of life. Similarly, Inma's optimism should be tempered with caution and preparedness. This newfound understanding has not magically resolved our differences, but it has opened the door to more open and empathetic communication. It has allowed me to express my fears in a way that invites dialogue rather than defensiveness, and it has encouraged Inma to acknowledge my concerns without dismissing them outright. As we continue to navigate the challenges of parenthood and partnership, I am learning to let go of the need for control and to embrace the unpredictability of life. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that I cannot protect Astra from every danger, just as I cannot rewrite the past or alter my family's history. Instead, I can strive to create a nurturing and supportive environment where Astra can grow and thrive, where fears can be voiced and addressed without judgment. This journey is ongoing, and there are still moments of tension and disagreement, but I am hopeful that, with time and patience, we can find a balance that allows us to move forward together, united in our love for Astra and our commitment to one another.",

The constant inquiries about your personal demons \u2013 the substance abuse, the legal troubles \u2013 wear you down, as if these struggles somehow define your artistic legacy more than the notes and rhythms you've crafted. That day with the Daily News reporter still haunts you; you could have unleashed your true feelings, could have declared your rightful place among the greats, but you held back, maintaining a dignified silence that somehow felt both noble and suffocating. It's exhausting, this dance between your inner artistic truth and the public's insatiable appetite for the peripheral details of your life, when all you really want is for them to truly hear the music.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "As I stepped into the oceanside house, I was immediately enveloped by the controlled chaos of a large family gathering. The living room had been transformed into an impressive dining space, with furniture pushed aside to accommodate what seemed like an endless table setting. The kitchen was a hive of activity, filled with the warmth of bodies and the aromatic promise of a feast to come. Everywhere I looked, there were signs of family life - scattered toys, well-loved dolls, and photographs of Bonny, Sara, and Deborah adorning the walls. Deborah's entire family was present: her parents, siblings, and their partners, all dressed casually and radiating a youthful energy that made me increasingly conscious of my traditional shalwar kameez, which my mother had insisted I wear despite my protests.

The living room had been transformed into an impressive dining space, with furniture pushed aside to accommodate what seemed like an endless table setting. The kitchen was a hive of activity, filled with the warmth of bodies and the aromatic promise of a feast to come. Everywhere I looked, there were signs of family life - scattered toys, well-loved dolls, and photographs of Bonny, Sara, and Deborah adorning the walls. Deborah's entire family was present: her parents, siblings, and their partners, all dressed casually and radiating a youthful energy that made me increasingly conscious of my traditional shalwar kameez, which my mother had insisted I wear despite my protests.

That was more likely to be true of the fishermen than of the family in the sailboat, who were not locals but vacationers from Seattle. Boats went out at once, that morning, to search the mainland and island shores and the water. The drowned children were found first, in their life jackets, and by the end of the day the bodies of their parents were located as well. A grandfather who had accompanied them was not found until the following day. The bodies of the men who had been fishing together were lost, though the remnants of their boat washed up near Refuge Cove. Eric\u2019s body was recovered on the third day. Juliet was not allowed to see it. Something had got at him, she was told (meaning some animal), after the body was washed ashore. It was perhaps because of this\u2014because there was no question of viewing the body and no need for an undertaker\u2014that the idea caught hold among his old friends and fellow-fishermen of burning Eric on the beach.

The morning had started like any other, but as Eric prepared his boat for what should have been a routine check of his traps, the sky began to darken ominously. The storm that followed was sudden and merciless, claiming not only Eric's vessel but several others that had ventured out that day.

As I followed her, I realized that sometimes, rock bottom is just the beginning.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "Samsa found a dressing gown his size in the closet of the largest room. It looked like something he might be able to manage. He hadn\u2019t a clue what to do with the other clothes\u2014how to put them on, how to wear them. They were just too complicated: too many buttons, for one thing, and he was unsure how to tell front from back, or top from bottom. Which was supposed to go on the outside, and which underneath? The dressing gown, on the other hand, was simple, practical, and quite free of ornament. Its light, soft cloth felt good against his skin, and its color was dark blue. He even turned up a matching pair of slippers. He pulled the dressing gown over his naked body and, after much trial and error, succeeded in fastening the belt around his waist. He looked at himself in the mirror, clad now in gown and slippers. This was certainly better than walking around naked. It wasn\u2019t as warm as it might have been, to be sure, but as long as he remained indoors it would stave off the cold. Best of all, he no longer had to worry that his soft skin would be exposed to vicious birds. When the doorbell rang, Samsa was dozing in the biggest room (and in the biggest bed) in the house. It was warm under the feather quilts, as cozy as if he were sleeping in an egg. He woke from a dream. He couldn\u2019t remember it in detail, but it had been pleasant and cheerful. The bell echoing through the house, however, yanked him back to cold reality. He dragged himself from the bed, fastened his gown, put on his dark-blue slippers, grabbed his black walking stick, and, hand on railing, tottered down the stairs. It was far easier than it had been on the first occasion. Still, the danger of falling was ever present. He could not afford to let down his guard. Keeping a close eye on his feet, he picked his way down the stairs one step at a time, as the doorbell continued to ring. Whoever was pushing the buzzer had to be a most impatient and stubborn person. Walking stick in his left hand, Samsa approached the front door. He twisted the knob to the right and pulled, and the door swung in. A little woman was standing outside. A very little woman. It was a wonder she was able to reach the buzzer. When he looked more closely, however, he realized that the issue wasn\u2019t her size. It was her back, which was bent forward in a perpetual stoop. This made her appear small, though, in fact, her frame was of normal dimensions. She had fastened her hair with a rubber band to prevent it from spilling over her face. The hair was a deep chestnut and very abundant. She was dressed in a battered tweed jacket and a full, loose-fitting skirt that covered her ankles. A striped cotton scarf was wrapped around her neck. She wore no hat. Her shoes were of the tall lace-up variety, and she appeared to be in her early twenties. There was still something of the girl about her. Her eyes were big, her nose small, and her lips twisted a little to one side, like a skinny moon. Her dark eyebrows formed two straight lines across her forehead, giving her a skeptical look.",
    "paragraph2": "In the quiet solitude of his room, Samsa lay nestled within the comforting embrace of a large, cozy bed, the kind that seems to cradle one in dreams, with soft layers that could almost lull a person back to sleep even in the midst of wakefulness. The air was still, and the early morning light filtered gently through the curtains, casting a serene glow over the simple furnishings. Dressed in a dark blue dressing gown and matching slippers, Samsa found solace in the uncomplicated attire, a choice that offered ease and familiarity amidst the complexities of daily life. The simple fabric felt smooth against his skin, a welcome alternative to the often cumbersome and intricate clothing he typically avoided. Yet, the tranquility of the morning was abruptly shattered by the persistent ringing of the doorbell, a sound that cut through the silence with unyielding insistence. It was this noise, echoing persistently through the house, that roused Samsa from his drowsy state, urging him to rise from the comfort of his bed. With a sigh, he reached for his walking stick, a steadfast companion that not only provided physical support but a sense of security as he navigated the challenges of mobility. Carefully, he maneuvered himself out of bed, each movement deliberate and measured to avoid the danger of falling, a constant concern in his daily routine. The journey to the door was not a swift one, but Samsa approached it with patience, descending the stairs with cautious steps, the tap of his walking stick marking his progress. Upon reaching the door, he paused briefly, steadying himself before turning the handle and opening it to reveal the world beyond. There, on the doorstep, stood a young woman, her presence both unexpected and intriguing. Her posture was stooped, a subtle curvature that lent her an appearance of smallness despite the average proportions of her frame. Her hair, a rich chestnut hue, caught the light in a way that accentuated its natural warmth, cascading around her shoulders in gentle waves. She wore a tweed jacket, its texture adding an air of sophistication to her ensemble, paired with a loose skirt that moved softly with the breeze. The combination of her attire and demeanor presented a curious blend of youthful vibrancy and mature wisdom. Her eyes, however, held a skeptical expression, a look that suggested she approached the world with a questioning gaze, probing beneath the surface of things. It was a look that could both challenge and engage, demanding attention and reflection. As Samsa stood before her, he took in these details, each one painting a vivid picture of the visitor who had interrupted his morning. Her presence hinted at stories untold, mysteries wrapped in the everyday fabric of life, and as they exchanged greetings, Samsa was drawn into the subtle complexities of their encounter, his curiosity piqued by the unexpected blend of characteristics she embodied. In that moment, the ordinary act of answering the door became a doorway to possibilities, a reminder of the rich tapestry of human interaction and the unpredictable nature of the world outside his door.",

    "paragraph1": "Patricia Lockwood sat reading quietly as life unfolded around her at gate B6, where her attention was drawn to a peculiar sight that would later become a moment of unexpected solace. A couple, sporting matching mullets, engaged in an intimate ritual of brushing each other's hair, their synchronicity creating a touching display of affection that somehow lifted the weight of despondency from the observing woman's shoulders. As she watched them, her mind wandered to her own struggles with writing, grappling with the authenticity of words once they left the safety of her thoughts and entered the public sphere. The atmosphere shifted when a twenty-three-year-old influencer took the seat beside her, their shared understanding of the digital world creating an instant connection, marked by enthusiastic high-fives and animated conversation about their online experiences. Later, as Patricia stood before a crowd, she attempted to articulate a theory, but the words seemed to slip away like sand through her fingers, leaving her thoughts scattered and incomplete. The narrative then transported her to Vienna, where she found herself immersed in the city's architectural harmony, savoring rich cakes while admiring buildings that appeared to mirror one another in an endless architectural dialogue. The peaceful moment was interrupted during a ride on a Ferris wheel, as her phone buzzed with an urgent message from her mother, the content of which immediately cast a shadow over the otherwise serene experience. This sequence of events, moving from the intimate scene at the airport to the public speaking engagement and finally to the distant city of Vienna, wove together themes of connection, communication, and the unexpected ways in which moments of joy and concern could intersect in one's life, all while maintaining a delicate balance between personal observation and public performance.",
    "paragraph2": "Audio: Patricia Lockwood reads. Everyone at gate B6 was bathed in gold. She sat there with one foot off the edge of the earth, close to falling, until she saw the couple with matching extravagant mullets that hung down past their shoulder blades. The man took out a brush and began to fight through his mullet until it was free, and then he handed the brush to his wife and she began to fight through hers with the same consecrated look; these mullets were their acre and when God came down he would not find a rock, a stump, a weed. They shook out their hair together, as if it were all on the same head, joined hands, and rested.

A couple, sporting matching mullets, engaged in an intimate ritual of brushing each other's hair, their synchronicity creating a touching display of affection that somehow lifted the weight of despondency from the observing woman's shoulders. As she watched them, her mind wandered to her own struggles with writing, grappling with the authenticity of words once they left the safety of her thoughts and entered the public sphere. The atmosphere shifted when a twenty-three-year-old influencer took the seat beside her, their shared understanding of the digital world creating an instant connection, marked by enthusiastic high-fives and animated conversation about their online experiences. Later, as Patricia stood before a crowd, she attempted to articulate a theory, but the words seemed to slip away like sand through her fingers, leaving her thoughts scattered and incomplete. The narrative then transported her to Vienna, where she found herself immersed in the city's architectural harmony, savoring rich cakes while admiring buildings that appeared to mirror one another in an endless architectural dialogue. The peaceful moment was interrupted during a ride on a Ferris wheel, as her phone buzzed with an urgent message from her mother, the content of which immediately cast a shadow over the otherwise serene experience. This sequence of events, moving from the intimate scene at the airport to the public speaking engagement and finally to the distant city of Vienna, wove together themes of connection, communication, and the unexpected ways in which moments of joy and concern could intersect in one's life, all while maintaining a delicate balance between personal observation and public performance.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAudio: Patricia Lockwood reads. Everyone at gate B6 was bathed in gold. She sat there with one foot off the edge of the earth, close to falling, until she saw the couple with matching extravagant mullets that hung down past their shoulder blades. The man took out a brush and began to fight through his mullet until it was free, and then he handed the brush to his wife and she began to fight through hers with the same consecrated look; these mullets were their acre and when God came down he would not find a rock, a stump, a weed. They shook out their hair together, as if it were all on the same head, joined hands, and rested. She sat in the gold that made them the same and felt a little less like dying. \u2022 The cursor blinked where her mind was. She put one true word after another and put the words in the portal.

The boy, who had been lying on Juju, our faithful canine companion, was roused by his father's voice, signaling that it was time for them to take their leave. As the boy sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, the man and I delved into a discussion about the conclusion of his story, which had revolved around the themes of learning to swim and the poignant loss of his grandfather.

    "paragraph1": "Growing up on Jefferson Avenue, I often found myself reflecting on my complicated relationship with Jackie Rand, the neighborhood bully. Jackie lived in a house just a few doors down from my apartment, and while others saw him as rough and mean, I had a peculiar ability to calm him, much like one would soothe a stray dog. Jackie had a troubled home life, which I believed contributed significantly to his behavior. His mother had passed away, leaving him in the care of a father who was not only abusive but also saw Jackie as little more than a burden. This harsh view was matched by his stepmother, May, who did nothing to ease the burden of his upbringing. In our neighborhood, all the children, myself included, were no strangers to physical discipline. Our parents were laborers, hardened by their own struggles, and saw physical discipline as a necessary tool for raising their children. The nuns at school were no different, perpetuating a culture of violence that trickled down to us kids. But Jackie\u2019s father took it to extremes, treating Jackie as an adversary rather than a son. This harshness was a defining factor in Jackie\u2019s contentious demeanor. He wasn\u2019t born a bully; rather, he was molded by the relentless challenges of his family dynamics and the unforgiving environment we all inhabited. While other children responded to their harsh realities with varying degrees of acceptance or rebellion, Jackie lashed out, perhaps as a defense mechanism against a world that seemed constantly against him. I understood this, perhaps more than anyone else, and it allowed me to connect with him in a way that defied his usual behavior. Our interactions were like a quiet truce amidst the chaos, moments where Jackie seemed to find a sliver of peace. I imagined that in those rare instances, he could momentarily escape the adversarial world he lived in. Our neighborhood was a place where the adults\u2019 struggles bled into the lives of the children, creating a cycle of hardship that seemed unbreakable. Yet, despite the bleakness of our surroundings, I found a strange kinship with Jackie. Though he was often feared, I couldn\u2019t help but see the scared, hurt boy beneath the tough exterior. It was this understanding that drove me to approach him with empathy rather than fear, and in doing so, I discovered the power of compassion in the face of adversity. Jackie\u2019s story was a reminder that behind every tough demeanor lies a narrative of struggle, and sometimes, all it takes is a little kindness to uncover the vulnerability hidden beneath.

    "paragraph1": "Loneese and Horace lived together, yet their lives had become a labyrinth of solitude, each navigating their own separate existence within the confines of their shared home. The chasm between them had grown so vast that it seemed insurmountable, a constant reminder of the love and connection they once shared, now lost to the passage of time. In a poignant manifestation of their estrangement, Loneese purchased a small icebox for her bedroom, a symbol of her desire for independence and self-sufficiency. Horace, fueled by a deep-seated distrust, acquired a separate telephone, a tacit acknowledgement of the breakdown in communication that had come to define their relationship. Their son, Alonzo, lived in Baltimore, a physical and emotional distance that seemed to mirror the gulf between his parents.

The younger twin, his legs pumping furiously as he struggled to keep up, failed to notice the barbed wire stretching across their path and tripped, his palms scraping against the rough earth. His brother quickly pulled him to his feet, and they continued running, their eyes scanning the trees for any sign of their friend Eykelboom, who had also fled to escape his father's wrath. For what felt like an hour, they searched the woods, their calls of \"Eykelboom!\" going unanswered. Eventually, they made their way back to the street, where they were met with an ominous sight: a police cruiser parked in front of the Eykelbooms' house, its lights flashing lazily. Eykelboom's father stood on the porch, his face twisted in anger as he spoke with a police officer. The boys approached cautiously, their eyes fixed on the stick still clutched in Eykelboom's father's hand. \"You're the ones who've been hurting my boy,\" he spat, his eyes flashing with accusation. Wayne stepped forward, his face set in a defiant expression. \"That's not true,\" he said, his voice steady. \"You're the one who's been beating him. That's why he ran away.\" The police officer intervened, his voice firm but calm. \"Put the stick down, sir. Let's go inside and talk about this.\" Eykelboom's father hesitated, his grip on the stick tightening before he finally relinquished it, his eyes never leaving the group of boys. The officer turned to the boys. \"You kids okay?\" he asked, his eyes scanning their faces. \"Do any of you know where Eykelboom is?\" The boys shook their heads, their faces somber with worry. As they stood there, the only sound the quiet hum of the police cruiser, they couldn't help but wonder what would happen next.",

They listened for Eykelboom ahead of them as they ran. Instead they heard his father, following. They ran in the dark on the trail that followed the creek to the crossing upstream. They tripped over vines and roots and stumbled in ruts but kept going. They scrambled down the upper creek bank, jumped the creek, and ran up the other side.

The younger twin, his legs pumping furiously as he struggled to keep up, failed to notice the barbed wire stretching across their path and tripped, his palms scraping against the rough earth. His brother quickly pulled him to his feet, and they continued running, their eyes scanning the trees for any sign of their friend Eykelboom, who had also fled to escape his father's wrath. For what felt like an hour, they searched the woods, their calls of \"Eykelboom!\" going unanswered. Eventually, they made their way back to the street, where they were met with an ominous sight: a police cruiser parked in front of the Eykelbooms' house, its lights flashing lazily. Eykelboom's father stood on the porch, his face twisted in anger as he spoke with a police officer. The boys approached cautiously, their eyes fixed on the stick still clutched in Eykelboom's father's hand. \"You're the ones who've been hurting my boy,\" he spat, his eyes flashing with accusation. Wayne stepped forward, his face set in a defiant expression. \"That's not true,\" he said, his voice steady. \"You're the one who's been beating him. That's why he ran away.\" The police officer intervened, his voice firm but calm. \"Put the stick down, sir. Let's go inside and talk about this.\" Eykelboom's father hesitated, his grip on the stick tightening before he finally relinquished it, his eyes never leaving the group of boys. The officer turned to the boys. \"You kids okay?\" he asked, his eyes scanning their faces. \"Do any of you know where Eykelboom is?\" The boys shook their heads, their faces somber with worry. As they stood there, the only sound the quiet hum of the police cruiser, they couldn't help but wonder what would happen next.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThey leaped over the fence back into the woods. When the younger twin caught his foot on the barbed wire and fell, hollering, they stopped to see if he was O.K. But Eykelboom\u2019s father was still coming toward them through the vacant lot, the stick in his hand, and they took off running again down the dark trail. They listened for Eykelboom ahead of them as they ran. Instead they heard his father, following. They ran in the dark on the trail that followed the creek to the crossing upstream. They tripped over vines and roots and stumbled in ruts but kept going. They scrambled down the upper creek bank, jumped the creek, and ran up the other side. They heard Eykelboom\u2019s father far back on the trail\u2014he had no flashlight and didn\u2019t know these woods\u2014calling out to his boy. The boys called out then, too\u2014Eykelboom! Emile!

My second wife, my anchor in these turbulent times, immediately springs into action, her gentle hands helping me shed my coat like a second skin of despair. She guides me to the armchair \u2013 my refuge \u2013 and I sink into its embrace, watching through half-closed eyes as she flutters around me with practiced devotion. Later, her touch remains tender as she undresses me, each movement deliberate and caring, the bathwater she's prepared hitting the perfect temperature that soothes my aching muscles and troubled mind. Yet, even in these moments of pure devotion, my demons refuse to rest. After lying beside her, feeling her warmth and steady breathing, an irrational fear grips me \u2013 a sudden, poisonous suspicion that makes me lash out with accusations of future betrayal.

She often wonders if being their biological child would have granted her deeper insight into their dynamic, a question that haunts her even now. Her own romantic history bears the weight of two failed marriages, with Peter's words echoing in her mind about her inability to take herself seriously\u2014a observation that cuts deeper than she'd care to admit. The label \"toxic\" bestowed upon her by both ex-husbands doesn't sting as much as it perhaps should; instead, she finds herself respecting their clarity in identifying the poison and choosing self-preservation over slow deterioration. Her attention shifts to the peculiar relationship between Peipei and Mr. Wu, where she's learned to navigate the delicate balance of maintaining professional courtesy while carefully avoiding any interaction that might trigger Peipei's possessive nature. Bella observes how Peipei's devotion to Mr. Wu has transcended the typical boundaries of youthful infatuation, transforming into something more permanent and perhaps equally toxic in its own right. The fairy-tale quality of Peipei's unwavering loyalty seems to Bella like another form of poison, one that has seeped so deeply into the fabric of their relationship that it's become indistinguishable from love itself, making her question the fine line between dedication and destruction in matters of the heart.",

My mother didn\u2019t complain, though we were all sticky and irritable. Instead, she pulled out an old radio, tuned it to a jazz station, and started making lemonade from the bruised lemons in the fridge. I watched her move around the kitchen, her ponytail swaying as she hummed with the music.

That\u2019s when I saw her, really saw her\u2014more than just a mother but a woman who navigated life's relentless grind with grace.

Instead, she pulled out an old radio, tuned it to a jazz station, and made a bruised lemonade. I watched her move around the kitchen, her ponytail swaying as she hummed with the music. She almost made that awful day feel sweet. When she handed me a glass, her fingers were cool and her eyes were calm, unwavering. I had never before seen her as more than a mother; she was a woman of inordinate grace. Her attractiveness was in how she handled adversity with an understated elegance, elevating life without needing to be seen. In that moment, I understood the depth of her resilience and felt a newfound admiration that stretched beyond the bounds of familial expectation.",

It was a blistering summer day, the kind that saps your energy just by existing, and the air conditioning in the house had given up. My mother didn\u2019t complain, though we were all sticky and irritable. Instead, she pulled out an old radio, tuned it to a jazz station, and started making lemonade from the bruised lemons in the fridge. I watched her move around the kitchen, her ponytail swaying as she hummed with the music. She took that moment, suffused with heat and discomfort, and transformed it into something bearable, almost sweet. When she handed me a glass, her fingers were cool and her eyes were calm, unwavering. That\u2019s when I saw her, really saw her\u2014more than just a mother but a woman who navigated life's relentless grind with grace. Her attractiveness was in how she handled adversity with an understated elegance, reframing ordinary life into something more, without ever asking for recognition. In that moment, I understood the depth of her resilience and felt a newfound admiration that stretched beyond the bounds of familial expectation.\n\nParagraph 2:\nI was seventeen when I discovered my mother\u2019s quiet strength, which until then totally escaped me.
