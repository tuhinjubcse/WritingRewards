Modern Love comenz\u00f3 el mismo a\u00f1o que Facebook, tres a\u00f1os antes que los iPhone, ocho a\u00f1os antes que Tinder y 11 a\u00f1os antes de que el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo fuera legal en todo Estados Unidos.

As I look back, I'm also reminded of the personal journey that has unfolded alongside the column's evolution. I was 41 when we launched, married with two young children, and navigating the challenges of balancing work and family life. Fast forward to today, and I'm 61, separated, and proud of the independent adults my children have become. The \"Modern Love\" column has been a constant in my life, a reminder that love, in all its forms, is a universal language that transcends borders, cultures, and generations. As I celebrate this milestone, I'm filled with gratitude for the privilege of sharing these stories with the world and for the lessons I've learned along the way about love, loss, and the human condition.\n\nParagraph 2:\nHace dos d\u00e9cadas, el 31 de octubre de 2004, apareci\u00f3 una breve nota en la portada de este diario junto con noticias sobre la salud de Yasser Arafat y las inminentes elecciones que se disputaban George W. Bush y John Kerry. Dec\u00eda as\u00ed: \u201cModern Love: Presentamos una nueva columna semanal sobre el amor y las relaciones. Hoy, Steve Friedman dice que est\u00e1 bien despu\u00e9s de que lo abandonaron. Bien. En serio\u201d. As\u00ed comenz\u00f3 mi largo y extra\u00f1o viaje como editor de Modern Love, hablando cada semana con desconocidos sobre los detalles m\u00e1s \u00edntimos de sus enredos rom\u00e1nticos, familiares y plat\u00f3nicos, y publicando despu\u00e9s sus historias para cientos de miles o incluso millones de lectores. Nunca so\u00f1\u00e9 que seguir\u00eda haciendo este trabajo 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, pero ha sido una carrera maravillosa. Con el tiempo, y con la ayuda de mi colega Miya Lee, Modern Love ha crecido y ahora incluye un p\u00f3dcast, libros, presentaciones en vivo, otra columna semanal, Tiny Love Stories, de 100 palabras y programas de televisi\u00f3n en Estados Unidos, India, Jap\u00f3n y los Pa\u00edses Bajos. Modern Love comenz\u00f3 el mismo a\u00f1o que Facebook, tres a\u00f1os antes que los iPhone, ocho a\u00f1os antes que Tinder y 11 a\u00f1os antes de que el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo fuera legal en todo Estados Unidos. El mundo ha cambiado mucho en dos d\u00e9cadas, y mi vida tambi\u00e9n. Cuando empec\u00e9 a escribir esta columna, ten\u00eda 41 a\u00f1os, llevaba 12 a\u00f1os casado y mis dos hijos estudiaban la escuela primaria. Ahora tengo 61, estoy separado desde hace tres a\u00f1os y mis dos hijos hace tiempo que se fueron de casa para trabajar y vivir de manera independiente.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "Last night, as I read my daughter the story of a seven-year-old boy lost in the snow and found by bears, I felt an unexpected weight in my chest. The tale speaks of how the boy, after being discovered by his human father, chooses to live half the year with his bear family and half with his human one, unable to fully let go of either world. As I turned the final page, my daughter already drifting to sleep, the parallels to our own reality struck me with crushing clarity. Like the boy in the story, she too lives between two worlds, shuttling between her father's house and mine, her life neatly divided by custody agreements and calendar dates. I wonder if the story's parents felt this same hollow ache I feel during the months she's away, if they too counted days until their child's return. Sometimes I think we're all lost in the snow somehow, searching for warmth in the spaces between hello and goodbye, learning to accept that love sometimes means letting go, if only for a season.",

The boy then must choose: \u201cHe felt that his heart was torn.\u201d He loves both his father and mother, so eventually he decides to spend half the year as a human and half as a bear. The soft peach glow of the sunset, the flowing fluorescence of the Northern Lights, only make the pain of his choice, of his parents\u2019 loss, even sharper. When I finished reading, I put the book down and said to my daughter, \u201cI would be so sad if you spent half the year away from me. I would cry just like the mama bear.\u201d And then a horrible realization washed over me: My daughter does spend half the year away from me. Our divorce agreement gives me 50 percent time with her. It may not feel like six months because she goes back and forth every few days. But in the end, it\u2019s the same. For half of the year, I am separated from my little cub.",

Raised in the tiny farming town of Ivanhoe, Minn., only a 15-minute drive from South Dakota\u2019s eastern border, Ms. Walz is the daughter of schoolteachers, and the eldest of four sisters. Ms. Walz was a caretaker in the family, according to her youngest sister, Heidi Ohlmann. \u201cShe\u2019s always looking out for everyone,\u201d Ms. Ohlmann said in an interview.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Bavarian Nordic offered additional information regarding what the W.H.O. calls \u201cprogrammatic suitability for use,\u201d he said. This refers to aspects of the vaccine that may influence how it can be used in different settings. The Jynneos vaccine, for example, needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius, but not all health centers in a country such as Congo will be able to keep vials of it that cold. Regulators in high-income countries do not typically evaluate a vaccine with these kinds of considerations. Most of the data collected on the Jynneos vaccine evaluated it for use on the Clade 2 mpox virus, a less lethal version that caused the 2022 global outbreak. But the Clade 1 virus is circulating in Congo and across East Africa, and the vaccine has not been tested against it. \u201cWe are not sure the efficacy on Clade 2 is transferable to Clade 1 \u2014 nobody has that information,\u201d Mr. Mubangizi said. Congo\u2019s own drug regulator approved Jynneos and the LC16 vaccine on June 27 \u2014 long after Nigeria, which had many mpox cases in the 2022 outbreak, did an approval of its own. The lengthy delay raised eyebrows in health agencies supporting Congo, but Dr. Kamba, the health minister, said the country has limited resources and a host of crises. \u201cWe have a lot of emergencies on our hands,\u201d Dr. Kamba said.\n\nParagraph 2:\nPharmaceutical companies and health regulators have been actively working to address mpox vaccination challenges across different regions. KM Biologics, based in Japan, has taken a significant step by submitting their vaccine documentation, while Bavarian Nordic has enhanced their proposal with supplementary data regarding their vaccine's adaptability to various healthcare settings. A notable obstacle in the vaccination effort is the stringent storage requirement of the Jynneos vaccine, which must be maintained at minus 20 degrees Celsius\u2014a specification that many health facilities in countries like Congo cannot meet. Adding to the complexity is the varying effectiveness of vaccines against different mpox virus strains, particularly between Clade 2 and Clade 1, with the latter being prevalent in Congo and East Africa. Mr. Mubangizi has voiced concerns about the vaccine's effectiveness specifically against Clade 1. The delayed approval of both Jynneos and LC16 vaccines by Congo's drug regulatory authority, especially when compared to Nigeria's swifter response, has raised apprehension among health organizations. Dr. Kamba, serving as Congo's health minister, attributes this delay to the nation's resource constraints and ongoing multiple crises, highlighting the complex challenges facing healthcare systems in developing nations.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, found that individuals using these medications exhibited a slightly reduced likelihood of experiencing suicidal thoughts compared to those who were not taking them. Utilizing a comprehensive database of anonymized electronic health records from over 100 million individuals, the researchers meticulously compared two distinct groups: those prescribed Wegovy or other weight loss drugs, and those receiving Ozempic or other blood sugar-lowering medications. The findings of this extensive analysis aim to provide reassurance to users of these drugs, highlighting a potential mental health benefit alongside their physical health uses. Importantly, the study was conducted independently of Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of both medications, ensuring the results were free from any conflicts of interest. This research not only contributes to the understanding of the multifaceted impacts of these medications but also underscores the importance of considering mental health outcomes when assessing the overall benefits of pharmaceutical interventions for chronic conditions like diabetes and obesity.",

Lane, who presides over the Purdue bankruptcy cases, has opted to maintain a pause on lawsuits against both Purdue and the Sacklers during a designated mediation period. This pause comes amidst strategic legal maneuvers by a government-appointed committee representing the creditors, who have taken significant steps by filing a claim against the Sacklers.

This tactic is frequently employed in bankruptcy cases as creditors strive to reclaim funds they contend were improperly reallocated. The committee's filing is comprehensive, including a request for a jury trial and a meticulously crafted draft complaint. Notably, Purdue Pharma itself is not directly advancing this claim; however, the company has shown its endorsement of the creditors' actions. Purdue has indicated that should mediation not yield a resolution, litigation will become an inevitable course, with the creditors' committee being optimally positioned to manage these claims.

    "paragraph1": "Mr. Leiserowitz said he witnessed that in his own neighborhood. \u201cWe were the first to put solar panels on a roof 10 years ago, and now there are dozens that have solar panels on the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I went out talking to people about it \u2014 it\u2019s because people can see that somebody else who\u2019s much like them has adopted this new technology.\u201d But collective changes, from reducing littering to wearing seatbelts to drinking less alcohol, often evolve gradually. It took many years and numerous initiatives to reduce smoking, for example. That included more education about the dangers, restrictions on smoking in public areas, prohibitive taxes on cigarettes, public stigma and greater access to programs that helped people quit. \u201cChanges are slow and hard to see \u2014 but when you look backward you see that things that seemed outlandish are increasingly commonplace,\u201d said Jason Mark, the editor in chief of Sierra Magazine, in a video interview. A 2019 report by Rare, a 50-year-old global nonprofit that uses behavioral insights to encourage action to protect the environment, examined seven personal choices and their impact on climate change: switching to an electric vehicle, reducing air travel, eating a plant-rich diet, offsetting carbon, reducing food waste, tending carbon-sequestering soil and purchasing green energy.",
    "paragraph2": "When Mr. Leiserowitz installed solar panels on his home as one of the first in his neighborhood, he noticed an interesting phenomenon: his neighbors began following his example. \"People started asking questions about the installation process, costs, and benefits,\" he recalls, demonstrating how technological adoption often spreads through social networks rather than direct advocacy. This pattern of behavior change through observation and social influence extends beyond solar panels to broader societal shifts, such as the dramatic reduction in smoking rates and littering over past decades. These transformations didn't happen overnight but through sustained efforts and gradual cultural evolution. As Jason Mark, Sierra Magazine's editor in chief, notes, \"What seems impossible today can become inevitable tomorrow. Just look at how quickly some social changes have occurred in recent years.\" This perspective is particularly relevant when considering climate action, as highlighted in a 2019 report by Rare, which examined seven key personal choices that can significantly impact climate change. The report reinforces the idea that individual actions, when multiplied across communities, can create meaningful environmental change, much like how Mr. Leiserowitz's solar panels sparked a neighborhood transformation.",

It took many years and numerous initiatives to reduce smoking, for example. That included more education about the dangers, restrictions on smoking in public areas, prohibitive taxes on cigarettes, public stigma and greater access to programs that helped people quit. \u201cChanges are slow and hard to see \u2014 but when you look backward you see that things that seemed outlandish are increasingly commonplace,\u201d said Jason Mark, the editor in chief of Sierra Magazine, in a video interview. A 2019 report by Rare, a 50-year-old global nonprofit that uses behavioral insights to encourage action to protect the environment, examined seven personal choices and their impact on climate change: switching to an electric vehicle, reducing air travel, eating a plant-rich diet, offsetting carbon, reducing food waste, tending carbon-sequestering soil and purchasing green energy.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWhen Mr. Leiserowitz installed solar panels on his home as one of the first in his neighborhood, he noticed an interesting phenomenon: his neighbors began following his example. \"People started asking questions about the installation process, costs, and benefits,\" he recalls, demonstrating how technological adoption often spreads through social networks rather than direct advocacy. This pattern of behavior change through observation and social influence extends beyond solar panels to broader societal shifts, such as the dramatic reduction in smoking rates and littering over past decades. These transformations didn't happen overnight but through sustained efforts and gradual cultural evolution. As Jason Mark, Sierra Magazine's editor in chief, notes, \"What seems impossible today can become inevitable tomorrow. Just look at how quickly some social changes have occurred in recent years.\" This perspective is particularly relevant when considering climate action, as highlighted in a 2019 report by Rare, which examined seven key personal choices that can significantly impact climate change. The report reinforces the idea that individual actions, when multiplied across communities, can create meaningful environmental change, much like how Mr. Leiserowitz's solar panels sparked a neighborhood transformation.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital, recognizes Reddit's distinctive position as a digital hub, fostering a unique online community. In 2006, Cond\u00e9 Nast acquired Reddit for $10 million, catapulting its founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, into early millionaire status. Following their departure, a small, dedicated team of \"Redditors\" took the helm, staunchly resisting changes to the platform's appearance and functionality to preserve the experience for its core users. Their reluctance to innovate led to a delayed development of a mobile app and a general disinterest in monetizing the site. This laid-back approach to moderation also resulted in the proliferation of toxic subreddits, which posed significant challenges for advertisers wary of associating with controversial content. Furthermore, many within Reddit's ranks were opposed to data collection and invasive advertising methods, creating internal friction regarding the platform's growth strategies. Despite these challenges, Reddit remains a unique entity on the internet, continually navigating the delicate balance between community engagement and commercial viability.",

Both founders eventually departed, leaving Reddit in the hands of a small team of hardcore \u201cRedditors\u201d who were very protective of the site.

Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital, recognizes Reddit's distinctive position as a digital hub, fostering a unique online community. In 2006, Cond\u00e9 Nast acquired Reddit for $10 million, catapulting its founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, into early millionaire status. Following their departure, a small, dedicated team of \"Redditors\" took the helm, staunchly resisting changes to the platform's appearance and functionality to preserve the experience for its core users. Their reluctance to innovate led to a delayed development of a mobile app and a general disinterest in monetizing the site. This laid-back approach to moderation also resulted in the proliferation of toxic subreddits, which posed significant challenges for advertisers wary of associating with controversial content. Furthermore, many within Reddit's ranks were opposed to data collection and invasive advertising methods, creating internal friction regarding the platform's growth strategies. Despite these challenges, Reddit remains a unique entity on the internet, continually navigating the delicate balance between community engagement and commercial viability.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\u201cReddit is one of those rare places on the internet where you find niche interests, and broad interests, all in the same place,\u201d said Alfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in the company. In 2006, Cond\u00e9 Nast bought Reddit for $10 million, turning Mr. Huffman and Mr. Ohanian into young millionaires overnight. Both founders eventually departed, leaving Reddit in the hands of a small team of hardcore \u201cRedditors\u201d who were very protective of the site. That team was adamantly against evolving how Reddit looked and worked, out of fear it would alienate its core users. They resisted building a mobile application well into the rise of the iPhone era, and were largely disinterested and did not have the bandwidth to turn Reddit into a moneymaking business.

Though our connection runs deep, our relationship remains beautifully platonic\u2014he's gay, I'm queer, and we've found in each other the kind of soulful friendship that transcends romantic boundaries. The dance class that brought us together became the backdrop for one of my most cherished relationships.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWe met at Soul Motion, dancing twice a week for years, whispering silly and racy jokes into each other\u2019s ears, cracking up as we twirled. After we shook our booties, we ate at a taqueria in Berkeley, Calif., and talked politics and philosophy with our dance friends. I\u2019m partnered; Michael\u2019s not. When the pandemic came, he texted, \u201cI miss you GF,\u201d with lots of loving emojis. I texted back, \u201cI miss YOU, BF,\u201d with golden hearts. Rivers of wit flowed between us. We\u2019ll never kiss. He\u2019s gay; I\u2019m queer. But when we meet up and dance, it\u2019s the best romance. \u2014 Jenny Freeman\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

A notable obstacle in the vaccination effort is the stringent storage requirement of the Jynneos vaccine, which must be maintained at minus 20 degrees Celsius\u2014a specification that many health facilities in countries like Congo cannot meet. Adding to the complexity is the varying effectiveness of vaccines against different mpox virus strains, particularly between Clade 2 and Clade 1, with the latter being prevalent in Congo and East Africa.

The delayed approval of both Jynneos and LC16 vaccines by Congo's drug regulatory authority, especially when compared to Nigeria's swifter response, has raised apprehension among health organizations.

A notable obstacle in the vaccination effort is the stringent storage requirement of the Jynneos vaccine, which must be maintained at minus 20 degrees Celsius\u2014a specification that many health facilities in countries like Congo cannot meet. Adding to the complexity is the varying effectiveness of vaccines against different mpox virus strains, particularly between Clade 2 and Clade 1, with the latter being prevalent in Congo and East Africa. Mr. Mubangizi has voiced concerns about the vaccine's effectiveness specifically against Clade 1. The delayed approval of both Jynneos and LC16 vaccines by Congo's drug regulatory authority, especially when compared to Nigeria's swifter response, has raised apprehension among health organizations. Dr. Kamba, serving as Congo's health minister, attributes this delay to the nation's resource constraints and ongoing multiple crises, highlighting the complex challenges facing healthcare systems in developing nations.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Despite its enduring popularity, the movie's tough-talking characters, including a reluctant Ripley, feel like caricatures of '80s excess. The addition of a young girl in peril, played by Carrie Henn, and a soulless corporate villain, played by Paul Reiser, complete with a stereotypical 80s power suit, only add to the film's predictable nature. James Horner's bombastic score doesn't help, often overwhelming the on-screen action. And yet, the iconic confrontation between Ripley and the alien queen remains a masterclass in suspense and tension.

Despite its enduring popularity, the movie's tough-talking characters, including a reluctant Ripley, feel like caricatures of '80s excess. The addition of a young girl in peril, played by Carrie Henn, and a soulless corporate villain, played by Paul Reiser, complete with a stereotypical 80s power suit, only add to the film's predictable nature. James Horner's bombastic score doesn't help, often overwhelming the on-screen action.

Set against the backdrop of France, this new series showcases Daryl's journey in a foreign land, providing a fresh perspective distinct from the original series that unfolded in Georgia. Reedus, deeply involved in the creative process, emphasizes how the incorporation of French elements and local writers has enriched the narrative, allowing for a unique storytelling experience that stands apart from its predecessor. The series' success is evident, with a second season already premiering and plans for future projects in Spain, further expanding its global footprint. Beyond his role as Daryl, Reedus is a man of many talents, engaging in film and photography, showcasing his versatility and passion for the arts. In his personal life, Reedus finds inspiration and influence from his young daughter, who has notably shaped his reading habits, offering a glimpse into the softer side of the actor whose on-screen persona is often seen navigating the harsh realities of a post-apocalyptic world.",

Set against the backdrop of France, this new series showcases Daryl's journey in a foreign land, providing a fresh perspective distinct from the original series that unfolded in Georgia. Reedus, deeply involved in the creative process, emphasizes how the incorporation of French elements and local writers has enriched the narrative, allowing for a unique storytelling experience that stands apart from its predecessor. The series' success is evident, with a second season already premiering and plans for future projects in Spain, further expanding its global footprint. Beyond his role as Daryl, Reedus is a man of many talents, engaging in film and photography, showcasing his versatility and passion for the arts. In his personal life, Reedus finds inspiration and influence from his young daughter, who has notably shaped his reading habits, offering a glimpse into the softer side of the actor whose on-screen persona is often seen navigating the harsh realities of a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWhen Daryl Dixon was introduced in the third episode of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d in 2010, few viewers could have predicted this half-feral-looking character would end up leading the series.

The relocation of filming from New Zealand to Britain marked a pivotal shift, compounded by the disruptions caused by Covid lockdowns and a writers' strike. These obstacles necessitated innovative solutions from the team, led by showrunners McKay and J.D. Payne. Amidst these challenges, McKay highlighted the evolving relationship between two central characters, describing it as a \"fresh flavor\" infused with Hitchcockian elements and a dark, toxic dynamic that added depth to the narrative. Actor Edwards, who portrayed Celebrimbor, found a unique connection between his character and Shakespeare's Richard II, noting their mutual vulnerability to flattery. This thematic exploration was further enriched by Edwards' commitment to authenticity, as he learned the intricate art of ring forging for a crucial scene. When the writers' strike forced McKay and Payne to pause their involvement, they entrusted the completion of production to director Brandstrom and executive producer Lindsey Weber, who were not bound by union restrictions.

Join the locals at Yugokorotei, a public bathhouse nestled within a ryokan in Annupuri, where you can unwind in a serene outdoor setting. But first, be sure to follow Japanese etiquette by bringing a modesty towel and soap, and cleansing thoroughly before entering the communal pool. Note that bathing suits are not allowed, and the onsen is gender-separated. As you settle into the 130-degree Fahrenheit mineral water, sourced from Mount Annupuri, you'll feel your muscles relax beneath the wooden pergola, surrounded by snow-covered boulders. For a mere 1,000 yen, you can indulge in this rejuvenating experience, a perfect way to round out a day on the slopes.

Join the locals at Yugokorotei, in a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) in Annupuri. Know the Japanese etiquette, such as bringing your own little \u201cmodesty towel\u201d and soap to cleanse thoroughly before dipping, naked (no bathing suits allowed), into a communal outdoor pool. Like most onsen, this one is separated by gender. The outdoor pool, under a wood pergola and surrounded by snow and boulders, features mineral water pumped from the base of Mount Annupuri. It may be cold outside, but you\u2019re relaxing your body and soul in about 130 degree Fahrenheit, mineral-rich bubbling water. Folding and placing the towel on your head is a custom. Cost: 1,000 yen.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

When those groups shrink, their sites become rarer.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

This unresolved grief had cast a long shadow over his life, manifesting in the stories he crafted as a means of keeping Sasha's memory alive and managing his profound loss.

He had tried to save her. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it to exhaustion,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve incorporated her into these stories I make up.\u201d\n\nParagraph 2:\nAndrey, once a vibrant part of the stoner bohemian community in the Pacific Northwest, found himself adrift as he transitioned from a promising yet indolent high school student to a young adult struggling to find his footing. Surrounded by a tight circle of gamer friends, Andrey was known for his sharp intellect and laid-back demeanor. However, as the years passed, he found himself caught in a cycle of transient minimum-wage jobs, his lack of direction becoming a growing concern for his friends, Sam and Olga. Both stage hands by profession, Sam and Olga worried about Andrey's future and endeavored to help by introducing him to their line of work. Despite their best efforts, Andrey's erratic behavior began to surface, resulting in a series of work-related incidents that raised red flags. Recognizing the need for professional help, Sam and Olga gently encouraged Andrey to see a therapist. During a pivotal session in 2018, Andrey bravely shared a harrowing experience from his past\u2014the traumatic memory of his twin sister Sasha's drowning when they were just eight years old. This unresolved grief had cast a long shadow over his life, manifesting in the stories he crafted as a means of keeping Sasha's memory alive and managing his profound loss. Acknowledging this deep-seated pain marked a turning point for Andrey, offering a glimmer of hope for healing and a path toward reclaiming his future.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Since its inception in 2016, Duet's Phoenix-based program has implemented a rigorous screening and training process for mentors, ensuring quality support for those in need. Similar initiatives, such as Penn's Caring Collective, have adopted varying commitment lengths to accommodate different volunteer schedules while maintaining program effectiveness. These localized efforts complement the work of larger organizations like the Alzheimer's Association, which provides comprehensive support through helplines and support groups for dementia patients and their caregivers. The structured approach to mentoring, combined with the flexibility to meet diverse needs, has proven successful in creating sustainable support networks that benefit both volunteers and recipients of care.",

They operate on a small scale, however. Duet\u2019s program, which like Penn\u2019s involves screening and training mentors, has about 20 pairs enrolled.

Since its inception in 2016, Duet's Phoenix-based program has implemented a rigorous screening and training process for mentors, ensuring quality support for those in need. Similar initiatives, such as Penn's Caring Collective, have adopted varying commitment lengths to accommodate different volunteer schedules while maintaining program effectiveness. These localized efforts complement the work of larger organizations like the Alzheimer's Association, which provides comprehensive support through helplines and support groups for dementia patients and their caregivers. The structured approach to mentoring, combined with the flexibility to meet diverse needs, has proven successful in creating sustainable support networks that benefit both volunteers and recipients of care.\n\nParagraph 2:\nMentoring can benefit both parties, said Justin McBride, a senior administrator at Duet: Partners in Health and Aging, which began a similar program in Phoenix in 2016. \u201cWe hear all the time that supporting another person in need gives mentors a sense of purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helps them make sense of their own journey.\u201d The relatively low cost of such volunteer programs could make them replicable in many locations. They operate on a small scale, however. Duet\u2019s program, which like Penn\u2019s involves screening and training mentors, has about 20 pairs enrolled.

These final gifts stand as silent guardians of future milestones, holding within their carefully preserved wrapping the last pieces of maternal guidance I'll ever receive.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, found that individuals using these medications exhibited a slightly reduced likelihood of experiencing suicidal thoughts compared to those who were not taking them. Utilizing a comprehensive database of anonymized electronic health records from over 100 million individuals, the researchers meticulously compared two distinct groups: those prescribed Wegovy or other weight loss drugs, and those receiving Ozempic or other blood sugar-lowering medications. The findings of this extensive analysis aim to provide reassurance to users of these drugs, highlighting a potential mental health benefit alongside their physical health uses. Importantly, the study was conducted independently of Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of both medications, ensuring the results were free from any conflicts of interest. This research not only contributes to the understanding of the multifaceted impacts of these medications but also underscores the importance of considering mental health outcomes when assessing the overall benefits of pharmaceutical interventions for chronic conditions like diabetes and obesity.",

Dr. Maldonado says she hopes the exhibition, with 100 artifacts, will challenge what she calls \u201csuperficial\u201d interpretations of women\u2019s roles that have riddled scholarship of the region. For decades, archaeologists have described sculptures of men as individuals in positions of power, like priests or rulers. They\u2019ve tended to brush aside sculptures of women as images of a fertility goddess. \u201cThe sculptures that you find in most of the museums here in Mexico, they interpret these sculptures as the deity Tlazolteotl,\u201d she said. But Dr. Maldonado thinks there\u2019s too much variety in the sculptures to represent a single character, One piece depicts a bare-breasted woman with intricate scarification on her chest and shoulders. Another, with wide eyes and parted lips, known as the Young Woman of Amajac, wears a long skirt, blouse and a headdress that cascades to either side, like a waterfall.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Last year, Venice had to make do with precious few A-listers since the actors\u2019 strike barred anyone who had appeared in a big-studio film from doing press for it. That meant the Zendaya tennis romance \u201cChallengers,\u201d planned as the glamorous opening salvo for last year\u2019s festival, was yanked from the lineup and replaced by the Italian war drama \u201cComandante.\u201d While that movie had its scattered highlights, it didn\u2019t exactly have teenagers lining up for it at 11 in the morning.",

Groups of young people had set up camp, their eager faces turned towards the red carpet, all hoping to catch a glimpse of a star from Tim Burton's much-anticipated film, \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,\" which was set to open the Venice Film Festival. Among the crowd, a teenage boy stood with his parents, his eyes fixed on the entrance. His father broke the anticipation with a question, asking if Jenna Ortega, the popular actress, would be attending. The boy nodded shyly, prompting his parents to exchange knowing smiles, as if silently acknowledging a shared understanding of the boy's admiration for Ortega. It was fascinating to observe how casting stars like Ortega could generate such a fervent interest in films and festivals alike. This stood in stark contrast to the previous year's festival, which had been notably subdued due to an actors' strike that left it devoid of A-list celebrities. The strike had forced organizers to replace a high-profile film with a less glamorous one, and the resulting lack of star power had noticeably dampened the excitement among festival-goers. Today, however, the atmosphere was undeniably electric.",

As I surveyed the scene, a teenage boy pulled up on a bicycle, accompanied by his parents. All three craned their necks to check out the still-empty red carpet. \u201cJenna Ortega is going to be here?\u201d asked his father. The boy nodded shyly and his parents exchanged grins. \u201cThat\u2019s his great love, you know,\u201d the father said. Just as casting Ortega, the popular star of \u201cWednesday,\u201d helped juice interest in Burton\u2019s sequel, so too do glamorous movie stars turbocharge a film festival. Last year, Venice had to make do with precious few A-listers since the actors\u2019 strike barred anyone who had appeared in a big-studio film from doing press for it. That meant the Zendaya tennis romance \u201cChallengers,\u201d planned as the glamorous opening salvo for last year\u2019s festival, was yanked from the lineup and replaced by the Italian war drama \u201cComandante.\u201d While that movie had its scattered highlights, it didn\u2019t exactly have teenagers lining up for it at 11 in the morning.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I surveyed the bustling scene around the Palazzo del Cinema, I couldn't help but notice the palpable excitement in the air. Groups of young people had set up camp, their eager faces turned towards the red carpet, all hoping to catch a glimpse of a star from Tim Burton's much-anticipated film, \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,\" which was set to open the Venice Film Festival. Among the crowd, a teenage boy stood with his parents, his eyes fixed on the entrance. His father broke the anticipation with a question, asking if Jenna Ortega, the popular actress, would be attending. The boy nodded shyly, prompting his parents to exchange knowing smiles, as if silently acknowledging a shared understanding of the boy's admiration for Ortega. It was fascinating to observe how casting stars like Ortega could generate such a fervent interest in films and festivals alike. This stood in stark contrast to the previous year's festival, which had been notably subdued due to an actors' strike that left it devoid of A-list celebrities. The strike had forced organizers to replace a high-profile film with a less glamorous one, and the resulting lack of star power had noticeably dampened the excitement among festival-goers. Today, however, the atmosphere was undeniably electric.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Tables for four are more plentiful in restaurants than tables for five (which are really tables for six). Four people can fit in one cab and share two hotel rooms. What\u2019s more, traveling well with other people often boils down to personal rhythms: When do we like to wake up? How active are we? How much time alone do we need? These factors, and even your bad trip with the organizer, say little about the quality of relationships, though. Your friends\u2019 (possibly pragmatic) decision is not evidence of dislike. Now, you say your partner can\u2019t afford international travel. So, why not plan an amazing domestic trip? You also hint at closer friends. Hello? They sound promising. There\u2019s certainly no harm in telling the international travelers that you would be keen to join them next time. Honor your hurt feelings, but don\u2019t blow this one episode out of proportion, OK?\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs you watch your friends embark on an international adventure without you, it's natural to feel left out. But consider this: traveling in a group of four is often more convenient than five, with easier seating arrangements and accommodation options. It's not that your friends don't value your company, but rather that they may have been forced to make practical decisions. When traveling with others, personal rhythms and preferences can also come into play, and sometimes it's simply easier to coordinate with a smaller group. Don't take it personally - it's not a reflection of your relationships. Instead, consider planning a domestic trip or expressing interest in future international adventures with your friends. Acknowledge your feelings, but avoid overreacting. Remember that there will be other opportunities to travel with your friends, and in the meantime, you can start exploring alternative destinations and itineraries that cater to your own interests and preferences.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It conducts more than 27,000 caregiver support groups nationally.\n\nParagraph 2:\nJustin McBride, a senior administrator at Duet: Partners in Health and Aging, has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of mentoring programs in supporting individuals facing health challenges. \"The impact is profound on both sides of the relationship,\" McBride notes, emphasizing how mentors often find as much meaning in the experience as their mentees. Since its inception in 2016, Duet's Phoenix-based program has implemented a rigorous screening and training process for mentors, ensuring quality support for those in need. Similar initiatives, such as Penn's Caring Collective, have adopted varying commitment lengths to accommodate different volunteer schedules while maintaining program effectiveness. These localized efforts complement the work of larger organizations like the Alzheimer's Association, which provides comprehensive support through helplines and support groups for dementia patients and their caregivers. The structured approach to mentoring, combined with the flexibility to meet diverse needs, has proven successful in creating sustainable support networks that benefit both volunteers and recipients of care.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

With hundreds of thousands of gallons of water flowing over the falls every minute, it is a journey like no other. Get wet on this wild ride to acclimate back to reality after the quiet of Niagara-on-the-Lake.

    "paragraph1": "The Justice Department sued TikTok on Friday for illegally collecting children\u2019s data, escalating a long-running battle between the U.S. government and the Chinese-owned app. TikTok broke the law by gathering personal information from users under the age of 13 without their parents\u2019 permission, according to the government\u2019s complaint. The company knowingly allowed children under the age of 13 to create and use TikTok accounts, the government said, and frequently failed to honor parents\u2019 requests to delete their children\u2019s accounts. The lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, said those practices violated both the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that restricts the online tracking of children, and a 2019 agreement between TikTok and the government in which the company pledged to notify parents before collecting children\u2019s data and remove videos from users under 13 years old. The suit, which also names TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, asks for the court to fine the companies over the violations. \u201cWith this action, the Department seeks to ensure that TikTok honors its obligation to protect children\u2019s privacy rights and parents\u2019 efforts to protect their children,\u201d said Benjamin C.

The lawsuit, which also names TikTok's parent company ByteDance as a defendant, alleges that the platform violated both the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and a previous settlement agreement by enabling young children to create accounts on the platform and subsequently failing to remove these accounts when parents requested their deletion. Filed in the Central District of California, the legal action seeks monetary penalties for these alleged violations, highlighting the government's growing concern over digital privacy protection for minors. Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C.

As of now, TikTok has maintained silence regarding these serious allegations, which could potentially result in substantial financial penalties and increased scrutiny of the platform's user verification and data collection practices.

    "paragraph1": "During the production of Season 2, the television series navigated a multitude of challenges, both logistical and creative, which significantly shaped the final product. The relocation of filming from New Zealand to Britain marked a pivotal shift, compounded by the disruptions caused by Covid lockdowns and a writers' strike. These obstacles necessitated innovative solutions from the team, led by showrunners McKay and J.D. Payne. Amidst these challenges, McKay highlighted the evolving relationship between two central characters, describing it as a \"fresh flavor\" infused with Hitchcockian elements and a dark, toxic dynamic that added depth to the narrative. Actor Edwards, who portrayed Celebrimbor, found a unique connection between his character and Shakespeare's Richard II, noting their mutual vulnerability to flattery. This thematic exploration was further enriched by Edwards' commitment to authenticity, as he learned the intricate art of ring forging for a crucial scene. When the writers' strike forced McKay and Payne to pause their involvement, they entrusted the completion of production to director Brandstrom and executive producer Lindsey Weber, who were not bound by union restrictions. With much of the writing already completed, Brandstrom and Weber skillfully navigated the remaining hurdles, ensuring that the season maintained its creative vision despite the turbulent production process.",
    "paragraph2": "The pair\u2019s relationship, a key story line in Season 2, is a \u201cfresh flavor\u201d for the show, McKay said: \u201cIt\u2019s like a little Hitchcock in there. And also the sense of a descent and a very dark, toxic relationship.\u201d Edwards, a prolific stage actor, said he was struck by the similarities between the character of Celebrimbor and Shakespeare\u2019s Richard II, whom he has played onstage \u2014 including the smith\u2019s susceptibility to flattery. Edwards learned how to forge a ring, with the help of a jeweler (there is a ringmaking scene where this came in handy). The series, which moved its base from New Zealand to Britain for Season 2, has weathered production disruptions, like much of Hollywood. Covid lockdowns stopped filming for its first season, and then, three weeks before the end of shooting this season, according to the showrunners, the union for writers in Hollywood went on strike. \u201cThat was one of the most challenging moments for us as showrunners on this show,\u201d McKay said. \u201cBut we had to stand with our guild and had to step away.\u201d At that point, much of the writing for Season 2 was complete, according to J.D. Payne, the other showrunner, and the pair charged Brandstrom, the director, and Lindsey Weber, one of the show\u2019s executive producers \u2014 neither of whom were in the writing union \u2014 with finishing production.",

The relocation of filming from New Zealand to Britain marked a pivotal shift, compounded by the disruptions caused by Covid lockdowns and a writers' strike. These obstacles necessitated innovative solutions from the team, led by showrunners McKay and J.D. Payne. Amidst these challenges, McKay highlighted the evolving relationship between two central characters, describing it as a \"fresh flavor\" infused with Hitchcockian elements and a dark, toxic dynamic that added depth to the narrative. Actor Edwards, who portrayed Celebrimbor, found a unique connection between his character and Shakespeare's Richard II, noting their mutual vulnerability to flattery. This thematic exploration was further enriched by Edwards' commitment to authenticity, as he learned the intricate art of ring forging for a crucial scene. When the writers' strike forced McKay and Payne to pause their involvement, they entrusted the completion of production to director Brandstrom and executive producer Lindsey Weber, who were not bound by union restrictions. With much of the writing already completed, Brandstrom and Weber skillfully navigated the remaining hurdles, ensuring that the season maintained its creative vision despite the turbulent production process.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe pair\u2019s relationship, a key story line in Season 2, is a \u201cfresh flavor\u201d for the show, McKay said: \u201cIt\u2019s like a little Hitchcock in there. And also the sense of a descent and a very dark, toxic relationship.\u201d Edwards, a prolific stage actor, said he was struck by the similarities between the character of Celebrimbor and Shakespeare\u2019s Richard II, whom he has played onstage \u2014 including the smith\u2019s susceptibility to flattery. Edwards learned how to forge a ring, with the help of a jeweler (there is a ringmaking scene where this came in handy). The series, which moved its base from New Zealand to Britain for Season 2, has weathered production disruptions, like much of Hollywood. Covid lockdowns stopped filming for its first season, and then, three weeks before the end of shooting this season, according to the showrunners, the union for writers in Hollywood went on strike. \u201cThat was one of the most challenging moments for us as showrunners on this show,\u201d McKay said. \u201cBut we had to stand with our guild and had to step away.\u201d At that point, much of the writing for Season 2 was complete, according to J.D. Payne, the other showrunner, and the pair charged Brandstrom, the director, and Lindsey Weber, one of the show\u2019s executive producers \u2014 neither of whom were in the writing union \u2014 with finishing production.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

We had been \u201ctrying to make it work\u201d for the past year. We fought bitterly, took breaks, got back together. I moved out of our shared house, back in, and out again. Then, in June 2018, a reasonably priced house came on the market during one of our \u201cLet\u2019s try again\u201d periods. The house was spacious: three bedrooms, a two-car garage and a fenced-in backyard. The mortgage was manageable for two people, but not for me alone. Which is why, after the final meeting with the real estate agent, we agreed to split the monthly payment down the middle. My credit was better, so I would be the only person on the actual paperwork, but I would have my partner\u2019s financial contribution and his construction skills to ease the stress of solo homeownership \u2014 if we could make our relationship work. Two months later, I closed on the house. Two days after that, we had one last fight and broke up for good, leaving me alone in the house with my cat.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I sit in my newly acquired home, surrounded by the eerie silence of a space that was meant to be shared, I'm reminded of the gamble I took on love and real estate. My partner, a skilled carpenter and house framer, and I had been navigating the tumultuous waters of our relationship for years, our frequent arguments and breakups a testament to our passion and instability. Despite our rocky past, we decided to take the plunge and buy a house together in Bozeman, Montana, a decision that seemed reckless in hindsight. With my better credit, I took on the mortgage, while my partner agreed to contribute financially and lend his expertise to renovation projects. But just weeks after closing, our relationship imploded in a final, brutal argument, leaving me alone in this sprawling space with only my cat for company. Now, as I wander the empty rooms, I'm forced to confront the uncertainty of my decision and the daunting prospect of starting anew, solo. The house, once a symbol of our shared dreams, has become a bittersweet reminder of what could have been, and the mortgage, a constant, nagging reminder of my own vulnerability.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nParagraph 2:\nDaryl Dixon, portrayed by Norman Reedus, has undergone a remarkable transformation from a minor character in \"The Walking Dead\" to the central figure of a successful spinoff series. Set against the backdrop of France, this new series showcases Daryl's journey in a foreign land, providing a fresh perspective distinct from the original series that unfolded in Georgia. Reedus, deeply involved in the creative process, emphasizes how the incorporation of French elements and local writers has enriched the narrative, allowing for a unique storytelling experience that stands apart from its predecessor. The series' success is evident, with a second season already premiering and plans for future projects in Spain, further expanding its global footprint. Beyond his role as Daryl, Reedus is a man of many talents, engaging in film and photography, showcasing his versatility and passion for the arts. In his personal life, Reedus finds inspiration and influence from his young daughter, who has notably shaped his reading habits, offering a glimpse into the softer side of the actor whose on-screen persona is often seen navigating the harsh realities of a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "The anime industry is increasingly tapping into the star power of athletes to broaden its appeal and reach new audiences. Leveraging their massive followings, these sports figures are becoming influential ambassadors for anime, dissolving outdated stereotypes and helping to mainstream the genre. Crunchyroll, a leading anime streaming service, exemplifies this strategy by involving prominent athletes in their promotional efforts. For instance, N.F.L. player Aidan Hutchinson has been featured as a presenter at an awards show, while the platform has also collaborated with the N.B.A. to create exclusive clothing lines. Rahul Purini, the president of Crunchyroll, emphasizes the effectiveness of these partnerships, noting that athletes can connect with diverse audiences who may not traditionally engage with anime.

Fast forward to today, and I'm 61, separated, and proud of the independent adults my children have become. The \"Modern Love\" column has been a constant in my life, a reminder that love, in all its forms, is a universal language that transcends borders, cultures, and generations.

Little did I know that this humble column would grow into a global phenomenon, expanding into a podcast, books, live presentations, a weekly column called \"Tiny Love Stories,\" and television programs in multiple countries. My colleague Miya Lee has been instrumental in this growth, and I'm grateful for her partnership. As I look back, I'm also reminded of the personal journey that has unfolded alongside the column's evolution. I was 41 when we launched, married with two young children, and navigating the challenges of balancing work and family life. Fast forward to today, and I'm 61, separated, and proud of the independent adults my children have become. The \"Modern Love\" column has been a constant in my life, a reminder that love, in all its forms, is a universal language that transcends borders, cultures, and generations. As I celebrate this milestone, I'm filled with gratitude for the privilege of sharing these stories with the world and for the lessons I've learned along the way about love, loss, and the human condition.\n\nParagraph 2:\nHace dos d\u00e9cadas, el 31 de octubre de 2004, apareci\u00f3 una breve nota en la portada de este diario junto con noticias sobre la salud de Yasser Arafat y las inminentes elecciones que se disputaban George W. Bush y John Kerry. Dec\u00eda as\u00ed: \u201cModern Love: Presentamos una nueva columna semanal sobre el amor y las relaciones. Hoy, Steve Friedman dice que est\u00e1 bien despu\u00e9s de que lo abandonaron. Bien. En serio\u201d. As\u00ed comenz\u00f3 mi largo y extra\u00f1o viaje como editor de Modern Love, hablando cada semana con desconocidos sobre los detalles m\u00e1s \u00edntimos de sus enredos rom\u00e1nticos, familiares y plat\u00f3nicos, y publicando despu\u00e9s sus historias para cientos de miles o incluso millones de lectores. Nunca so\u00f1\u00e9 que seguir\u00eda haciendo este trabajo 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, pero ha sido una carrera maravillosa. Con el tiempo, y con la ayuda de mi colega Miya Lee, Modern Love ha crecido y ahora incluye un p\u00f3dcast, libros, presentaciones en vivo, otra columna semanal, Tiny Love Stories, de 100 palabras y programas de televisi\u00f3n en Estados Unidos, India, Jap\u00f3n y los Pa\u00edses Bajos. Modern Love comenz\u00f3 el mismo a\u00f1o que Facebook, tres a\u00f1os antes que los iPhone, ocho a\u00f1os antes que Tinder y 11 a\u00f1os antes de que el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo fuera legal en todo Estados Unidos. El mundo ha cambiado mucho en dos d\u00e9cadas, y mi vida tambi\u00e9n. Cuando empec\u00e9 a escribir esta columna, ten\u00eda 41 a\u00f1os, llevaba 12 a\u00f1os casado y mis dos hijos estudiaban la escuela primaria. Ahora tengo 61, estoy separado desde hace tres a\u00f1os y mis dos hijos hace tiempo que se fueron de casa para trabajar y vivir de manera independiente.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The tale speaks of how the boy, after being discovered by his human father, chooses to live half the year with his bear family and half with his human one, unable to fully let go of either world.

Although their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, Dr. Daniel Faustin, the director of the hospital's division of maternal and fetal medicine, emphasized the importance of prioritizing Ms. Hermelyn's care, given her high-risk pregnancy and vulnerability to serious infection and hemorrhaging if she were to deliver at home. \"The hospital is the safest place for her to be,\" Dr. Faustin stressed, highlighting the need to ensure Ms. Hermelyn's life was not at risk following this traumatic experience. Despite the tragic outcome, the hospital's efforts underscore the critical role that institutions like Wyckoff Heights play in providing vital care to vulnerable populations.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Once the new plant becomes fully operational, EuBiologics will achieve an impressive annual production capacity of 46 million doses, marking a significant milestone in their mission to increase global vaccine accessibility.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTo cover the gap in vaccine production, Rachel Park, the director of international business at EuBiologics, said the company decided to try to simplify its vaccine formula, streamlining steps and ingredients so it could make more doses faster. The company was then making more of the bulk drug product than it could put into tubes quickly, so it contracted a second Korean firm to assist. EuBiologics also invested in construction of a second manufacturing site that would double the amount of the vaccine the company could make. The company has taken the lengthy and expensive steps of having both the simplified vaccine and its new facility approved by the World Health Organization in a process called prequalification, which means that countries will not have to administer their own regulatory assessments. When the new plant starts producing the company will be able to make up to 46 million doses a year.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

In an interview after her poignant on-screen departure, I caught myself referring to her as \"Mariko-sama\" - a term of reverence that slipped out unexpectedly, like a subconscious farewell. Only now do I realize the profound impact her journey had on me, a resonance that went unnoticed during filming. I'm left with a sense of awe and gratitude for the experience, and a renewed commitment to approaching future projects with the same level of dedication and emotional investment that Mariko inspired in me.",

    "paragraph1": "A comprehensive study led by Sarah Mills, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina's School of Public Health, delved into the ramifications of menthol cigarette bans across various regions, including Canada, the European Union, and specific U.S. states like Massachusetts. The researchers meticulously reviewed existing studies, smoking rates, and cigarette sales data. Their analysis revealed that implementing a menthol cigarette ban would likely have a pro-equity impact, significantly decreasing smoking rates among Black individuals more than other racial or ethnic groups. This finding underscores the potential for such a ban to contribute to reducing health disparities linked to smoking. By targeting menthol cigarettes, which have been disproportionately marketed to Black communities, policymakers could effectively address smoking-related health inequities. This conclusion aligns with broader public health objectives aimed at promoting equitable health outcomes across diverse populations.",
