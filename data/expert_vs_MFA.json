I did this not only because I had confidence in his taste and his intellect; his opinion was very important to me because, unlike my mother, he had not opposed my wish to become a writer. At that point, my father was not with us, but far away. I waited impatiently for his return. When he arrived, two weeks later, I ran to open the door. My father said nothing, but he immediately threw his arms around me in a way that told me he had liked the book very much. For a while, we were plunged into the sort of awkward silence that often accompanies moments of great emotion. Then, when we had calmed down and begun to talk, my father resorted to highly charged and exaggerated language to express his confidence in me and in my first novel: he told me that one day I would win the prize that I have now received with such great happiness. He said this not because he was trying to convince me of his good opinion or to set the prize as a goal; he said it like a Turkish father, supporting his son, encouraging him by saying, “One day you’ll be a pasha!” For years, whenever he saw me, he would encourage me with the same words.My father died in December, 2002.",
        "MFA": "It was the next night when my father returned to my little apartment and I, anxious for his arrival, waited at the same wobbling card table on which I wrote the unbound novel he held in his hands. It had taken me two years to write it, and in those two years, my mother had refused to read a page. During one of her morning visits over lukewarm tea, she’d said “If it’s writing you want, I fail to see how work in advertising won’t fulfill you.” It was her tone that foretold that in leaping and striving for these dreams, we may lose sight of the path that had been carved for us long before. But my father read the entire novel. He had asked to. And when he slammed the pages onto my table, in the harsh return to the site of their creation, I was certain he would insist I write no more. I allowed myself to believe that, in the moment of silence after the table steadied, my words were so inept they could not draw near the man who best knew me. I believed this until he embraced me. I did not realize until much later, far beyond the glances of accumulated days behind me, that his momentary silence was the struggle for his own words. “One day,” he eventually said. “One day, my son will be a famous author. A Nobel prize author. One day.” The loose pages on the desk were an off-white bond paper, and it is these pages I have kept and oftentimes return to, long after I titled the manuscript Cevdet Bey and His Sons, long after it was sold and published, long after my relocating to a larger apartment in Istanbul and my father’s passing seven years later in December, 2002. I return to the typed and blue-hashed pages not to read but to see what my father had seen, to see him seeing his son and all his promise.",

        "MFA": "Sitting down to reflect on my life makes everything fall silent around me. I remember that I had committed to becoming a novelist at a very young age. My domestic circumstances were somewhat fortunate: although my mother believed I could commit myself to more useful professions like law and medicine, my father had always supported my ambition to become a writer. But one memory of my father is more significant than the rest. I remember that when, as a young man, I wrote my first novel, “Cevdet Bay and His Sons,” I sent a copy to my father for his opinion. Till I heard back from him, my days were consumed by the anxiety of what he might have to say. I came to care for my father’s opinion and approval more than anyone else’s. I had been waiting for my father to return home. I wanted to know his thoughts. On the day of his arrival, I stood by the door of our house and looked at him like I was nothing more than a child. My father must have understood what I was asking him. He walked up to me and embraced me. Although he didn’t say a word, I understood that he approved of my manuscript. For a few days, my father refused to talk about the manuscript but later, one cold evening, he expressed a strong and optimistic confidence about my future writing career. Like a proud father he said \"Aslanım olacaksın.\" He didn’t name a prize but he predicted that I would go on to receive a prestigious one. When my father died in 2002, I looked outside the window and imagined that door by which I stood waiting for him and remembered his words of encouragement. Sometimes, when I am alone, I still feel the warmth of that embrace.",

        "MFA": "I had given it to him at last, my first novel, “Cevdet Bey and His Sons,” and I waited with equal parts fear and excitement for his reaction to it. The book took me several years to complete and the time had not come easily; my mother had not supported the endeavor and took every opportunity to disparage this sodden “waste of youth” while my father quietly, gently, encouraged me with small gifts and an allowance. I knew better than to try convincing my mother, though those modern writers who I hoped to emulate in the West had taken a similar commitment to writing, she did not respect them, and would not want me to achieve a similar goal to any of theirs. I saw my father from across the boiled asphalt lot and felt my fears realized in his step—would he join my mother after reading my manuscript? I rose from my car to meet him. I searched for a hint of his answer in his gait or his eyes and saw nothing but the movements and recognition of an animal. Perhaps my father’s support ended now, perhaps I had failed him, perhaps this moment would end this chapter of my life and its purpose. All my anxieties melted when we embraced. He surged toward me as we met, pumping his arms to pat me on the back with reverent enthusiasm, then pulling my close to his chest as he had when I was a child, and I felt his pride. He held me out in front of him and smiled. “You will succeed, my son,” he said. “You will win prestigious prizes and teach somewhere.” It is this memory I cling to after his death in 2002—how he remained such a father to me.",

It probably cost more, strictly speaking, than he could afford, but I did not think of that, having a country girl’s notion that all men who lived in the city, wore a suit every day, and sported such clean fingernails had reached a level of prosperity where indulgences like this were a matter of course.",
        "MFA": "Ernie Botts. Ernie. My younger cousin, who was to remain a lifelong bachelor, had once spent each summer with us on the farm, showing up shyly in tow that first season in the shadow of my Aunt Nell. I hadn’t liked having to share a room with my sister, as I did when he came to visit. But he made up for it, with his good-natured affability, and his curious habit of punctilious grooming. I’d had the idea to call him Earnest Bottom-and my use of this nickname behind his back brought my sister and myself no end of amusement. The visits stopped when Aunt Nell passed, Ernie then thirteen. His presence in our house dwindled to a card each Christmas in his spidery handwriting. At eighteen I took the train out to the city, planning to start university at last and my new life. That my cousin lived there too was the last thing on my mind. It was my mother who reminded me. She told me I should look him up, conjuring at once his easy, slightly high-pitched laugh, his perfectly brushed wool sweaters. From then, Ernie and I had dinner every other Sunday, at a place called the Old Chelsea. I wasn’t sure why. I couldn’t tell if he had real fondness for me. His old habits of grooming were accompanied now by a certain formality of speech. It wasn’t a cheap restaurant either, but one of those old-style, stiff tablecloth establishments that used to be in vogue then. We always had three courses and wine. I assumed his loyalty to the Old Chelsea, and to me, meant he could easily afford such luxuries.",

        "MFA": "Aunt Nell used to tote Cousin Ernie Botts to the farm every summer like he was an old handbag or umbrella. He never seemed to mind, smiling banally to show off his fantastic straight, white teeth. He was a clean boy, a good boy, so much so that in the privacy of my own mind, I called him Earnest Bottom. When Aunt Nell passed, there was no one to drag sweet Ernie around, so we stopped seeing him for a while. Mother made sure to send him Christmas cards every year, and I’d doodle him little flowers and rainbows on the back. After I was accepted into college, I wrote him a little note instead, telling him I’d be moving to his city. He wrote back saying we really ought to get dinner once I was settled. We did, and it morphed into an every-other-Sunday affair. Ernie would pick me up at my dorm and drive me to a charming little restaurant called the Old Chelsea. Ernie insisted on us ordering two appetizers each, a main course, dessert, and of course, an after-dinner coffee. The checks, when I managed to glimpse them, always made my eyes bug. But Ernie was a good person, and the elaborate dinners never seemed to me a desire to show off, but rather a way to remain a part of the family. If he could spend so confidently every other week, I presumed he was working one of those legitimate office jobs. He never did talk all that much about himself.",

        "MFA": "It is impossible to think of the Old Chelsea without thinking, too, of Earnest Bottom. His real name, of course, was Ernie Botts—my slightly younger and far more sophisticated cousin. We'd spent many summers together as children at my family's farm. Ernie was prim and manicured and always seemed to be dusting off his pants or scraping mud from the soles of his shoes. At Aunt Nell's funeral, he shook everyone's hands in his freshly pressed suit and thanked them for the flowers. He stopped coming to the farm after that, but we kept in touch through Christmas cards, which he always signed with a kind, personalized note. Our paths ran perpendicular again when I went to graduate school in his city. As soon as he heard I was in town, he locked me into his calendar for dinner every other Sunday. The Old Chelsea had an excellent fillet mignon, he told me, and it was true. The food offset the conversation, which was stale at best. Talk of work and school died out quickly, and I felt guilty talking about my social life—while I was making friends and had started going steady with a classmate, Ernie seemed to be suspended in self-imposed monkhood. Somehow, the bill always ended up in Ernie's hands. “It’s the least I can do,” he’d say, batting away the money I offered, and I couldn’t help but wonder what he thought he owed me.",

Guns were for the guards, specially picked from the Angels.

We always thought of ourselves as girls in that place, but we were women in every sense of the word—bleeding and hungry and raging. We couldn’t speak to each other, couldn’t touch each other, couldn’t look Aunt Elizabeth in the eye and especially not Aunt Sara. Every wall was made of concrete and every meal was thin broth. Cold seeped in from everywhere. There were no clocks we were permitted to see, but time passed whenever the Aunts said it did, marching us from chore to chore at the end of their stinging cattle prods. There was sewing with dull needles and scrubbing floors that refused to get clean and carefully sorting through papers only to have them burned in the incinerator. Our voices shriveled in our throats from lack of use, but our eyes never forgot how to wander. They usually flitted up to the watch towers occupied by the Angels. Their faces were always turned away from us, and whenever we heard gunfire, it was aimed at someone on the outside. We imagined slipping up to the towers, unseen by the Aunts, and pulling down our gray, baggy shifts to reveal our narrow collarbones. We’d once been told this was our best feature. We imagined the Angels releasing us back into the world, a world we were sometimes convinced we’d dreamed up ourselves, a world where we didn’t have to touch our hair to remember what grass felt like. What would happen between the reveal of our bodies and our release was something our imaginations recoiled from, but whatever it might be, we could just keep our eyes closed until it was over, because everything—eventually—was over.",

Elizabeth sounded like the gold-tressed protagonist of an Austen novel who was ferocious on horseback, meek in conversation, entitled to marry well. But they were women with shorn scalps, black vests and black boots, skulking back and forth across the hallway, brute voices muffled by the door. They carried cattle prods and the first time I’d seen one, gripped in Elizabeth’s wide hand, I’d sniffed the compound for a mealy smell of animals but was met with fecund whiffs of soil and the tart odor of women under stress. Holly, Rozalyn, and I were middle-age with new wrinkles yet cloistered and monitored like boarding school miscreants. We had a box of a room with pocked floors and standard bunk-beds, blue sheets that reminded of a hospital and not the sky. And where was the fourth girl, smart-mouthed Sara? She’d talked back at gender studies that morning, suggesting a definition of women that was beyond the womb. Sara had too much ambition and ambition was what the cattle prods corrected. Outside our picture-book sized window was a big square of yellow grass and men with guns who called themselves Angels. My favorite guard had a roman nose and thick, tan neck. I imagined that if I got close enough, I could lave my tongue, cat-like, up his neck. I was convinced he’d love me just from this, from those few seconds of wet, lancing heat. He’d take me in his arms and run me to freedom. At twilight, he liked to shoot at the crows in the sky. With that rain of holy fire escaping his gun, he looked blessed and impossible to crucify, an angel indeed.",

We watch the Angels, too, guards who gaze into the distance as though they are somewhere else, far away. We imagine what it would be like to go to them, to touch their arms and their chests and their beards, to take off our clothes and show them our warm bodies, watch their faces unthaw at the sight of our soft and supple skin. We imagine a world where we beg for our freedom, for the chance to go outside, into the egg-colored sun, to step barefoot on the wet grass, to spin in the cool wind of the day. We imagine what it would be like to leave the cold, fetid horror of this place behind, let it become a memory, a vile, coppery taste at the backs of our throats. But we know better than to go to them. They are the ones with loaded guns, which they hold cradled in their arms like babies. We’ve seen what has happened to the girls who dare to speak to the Angels, the heaviness of a body when it falls to the floor after it’s been penetrated with a bullet, the deafening and definitive crack of the gunshot.

And Marianne herself, she would be another person completely. Would she ever have been happy? And what kind of happiness might it have been? All these years they've been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions. But in the end she has done something for him, she’s made a new life possible, and she can always feel good about that. I'd miss you too much, he says. I’d be sick, honestly. At first. But it would get better. They sit in silence now, Marianne moving the brush methodically through her hair, feeling for knots and slowly, patiently untangling them. There's no point in being impatient anymore. You know I love you, says Connell. I'm never going to feel the same way for someone else. She nods, okay. He's telling the truth. To be honest, I don’t know what to do, he says. Say you want me to stay and I will. She closes her eyes. He probably won’t come back, she thinks. Or he will, differently.

It’s a really big thing. I know. She wrapped her cardigan tighter around herself. It was cold in the room. Connell fidgeted. He sat on his hands and rocked back and forth, then said: It would be hard. Leaving all this. I won’t have the life that I have with you. It would be a half-life or something. It wouldn’t, said Marianne. You’d be wonderful. Really. She thought about them as two plants, sharing the same soil, growing toward the light together. She knew they would not be the same after they parted from each other, but that things would be all right. She looked out the window as big drops of rain came down, one after the other, flattening themselves against the glass. Connell wiped his nose on his sleeve. His eyes were pink. Marianne thought about it, what it would really be like. Connell would uproot out of the soil, their soil, and he would go somewhere new. And, while Marianne would miss him, and perhaps feel lonely, she would never feel unworthy again. She said, out loud: That’s something you can’t take away, isn't it? Connell looked at her and wiped a tear from the top of his lip. He seemed to understand. He nodded like he did, and the corner of his mouth betrayed the hint of a smile. People can change each other, Marianne thought, and it was true. They can really change each other. She looked out the window again. The rain was getting softer, and it seemed like it would stop very soon. She felt that she was looking at the future, a wavy, edgeless thing, grey with little speckles of light.",

        "MFA": "Remember how different we were when we first met, Connell said. Marianne paused, face warmed by his shoulder. She thought that perhaps they were at the sort of height one jumps from and survives jumping from, that she would, despite the loneliness, be able to carry on from this: two plants sharing a large pot, space and light made for them both as their stems grew in opposite directions. Often she felt this way with her friends. Sometimes young friendships to her seemed featherweight and passing, and even in the depths of real connection, these relationships felt unimportant and survivable. Survivable, she meant, if they ended. But with Connell, she would not really survive losing him forever. Marianne could not imagine for them any real or permanent parting, nothing as serious as death. This moment between them was unlike that unfathomable permanence and unlike how she felt with friends, and bearable for it. She told him this.You've been the person who shaped my life, really, Connell said, who I am today. She shrugged against him and felt sick to imagine them parted but could see in that possibility an uncertain future that took nothing from their certain past. You were the first person to really see me, she said, and then laughed at herself, insecure. In this way, pieces of their early dynamic still clung to her: a certain unsteadiness that sometimes made her mean but never cruel. A feeling, perhaps, that despite all they had meant to each other, there was some part of her still unworthy and always seeking more of him. But Connell smoothed her hair and sighed, his inhaling chest elevating hers, and said sadly, We were made to make each other into adults, I think. For a moment they, attached to each other, shared breath in an afternoon marked by parting but not only by sadness.",

Marianne smiles and looks down at the floor, where a puddle of water has formed from the snow in an obscure shape. She thinks about the first night she met Connell, the kiss they shared atop the washing machine in his mother’s house, and says, My life obviously wouldn’t be the same, either. You’ve done so much for me, really. When we first met, that first night at the house, I felt like I wasn’t worth anything to anyone. To be honest, there were nights when I might’ve wished I was dead. But you saw me, and you changed the way I saw myself. You’ve given me something that I didn’t even know was possible. Connell chuckles and wipes away with his shirtsleeve at a tear that has formed at the corner of his eye. I’m not sure I would know what it’s like to be seen without you, she continues. We’re sort of like two plants that have shared the same soil for their whole lives, always growing around each other without realizing it. But even though we’ve done so much good for each other, I know that things change and that we can’t control what will happen in the future. As she speaks, Marianne knows that things may never be the same between herself and Connell. She remembers again that first night in the house and the feeling of his warm lips on her ear, then imagines coming home to an empty house each night, with no one to leave empty mugs of tea out drying on the big windowsill overlooking the park. To be without him is almost unimaginable; then again, loneliness, she thinks, is a small price to pay for Connell’s happiness.",

I watched a girl near my age across the room dining at her own special table with an older man. I watched her through the mirror in case she might meet my eye. She was tan and lifted a spoon of creamy yogurt to her lips. I was lost, for a moment, in imagining its flavor. I had never tasted yogurt before. When our food came at last, it looked nothing like the pretty plate in front of the tan girl - the same way my clothes looked nothing like hers - the same way my skin matched the grey sky outside while hers glowed like the sun in the tropics. Later, in the streets and at home, my father repeatedly talked about the \"pig slop\" they served him at the restaurant and vowed never to return.

It was clear that both of us felt uncomfortable with the opulence of the space, but neither of us knew how to say so. Nearby, a girl around the age of fifteen sat with an older man, presumably her father, eating a foreign-looking food that I didn't recognize—a bowl of yogurt, I later learned. She looked deeply at ease eating her meal, and I was disturbed to see myself in the mirror on the adjacent wall—spectacled, pale. Compared to the girl, I looked homely and unimportant, or at least I felt that I did at the time. For a moment I imagined myself as the girl, tan and comfortable among the trappings of wealth, though even then I knew that the hallmarks of the working class were written all over my face and my behavior. My father and I sat for a while in silence, and when the waitstaff brought out our plates, he remarked to me that his mashed potatoes looked like \"pig slop.\" At the time, I thought he was just being fussy about his meal and I felt annoyed. Later I understood that he was deeply hurt at having been treated as second-class citizens who weren't ordering à la carte like the girl and her father, though he never said as much—he just continued talking about the potatoes, their unpleasant texture, their unsightly gray appearance.",

The waiter looked us up and down, seeing what we were immediately. I was pale from the winter, dressed in my worn, washed clothes. I wore spectacles, awkward and out of fashion, the kind you could buy at a steep discount. The waiter directed us to a shared table at the back of the restaurant, in front of the wash closet. At first my experience of discomfort was limited only to me. My father still had a big smile, ear to ear. But then I saw another father-daughter pair at a table in the restaurant’s big window. The girl was around my age, and pretty. She dealt with the restaurant staff confidently, with a confiding air, like they shared a special secret. I watched the girl longingly. Her tanned legs ended in delicate buckled shoes. I watched her eat food I could not identify. Back then, I’d never had yoghurt.As the waiter laughed and spoke to them in earshot of us, I saw my father growing red. “Those potatoes were pig slop,” he said after we left the restaurant, again and again. It embarrassed me. It was clear enough to both of us what had happened. At least, it was clear that we’d both had a bad time. I knew what he was saying. We had been treated as second-class citizens because we ordered the prix fixe, instead of selecting expensive dishes à la carte like the more sophisticated clientele. I wanted to forget about it.

From anger to confusion to something like heroism, the whispering heroism we all embody when we face our last moment. A heroism shining in the blue of her eyes, a deep, flickering blue which proclaimed how much she wanted to stay, here, with the rest of us, even as she left.

It lived inside her then, too, even as we bided time together at the very end, knowing there was only one thing left for her to do. Her fading life was a fire flickering down to smoke—it would only last as long as there was something to burn. There was bitterness too in her eyes, then bewilderment, then a stoic, quiet heroism. A commitment to her own dignity. A promise to endure this final test, no matter how unfairly it had been imposed on her.

Like any small city, Adyar was more like the world outside, than the outside world imagined Adyar to be. That summer, as early as dawn, worshippers were forced to use tattered gamchas around their necks to wipe the sweat off their foreheads as they prayed and chanted. While children screamed on Elliot’s beach, pretending they were Indiana Jones or Luke Skywalkers, Tamil music blared from carts, tempos, and scooters which clogged the streets. The women in houses leveled the air with the smell of instant coffee, being beaten cacophonously with a diabetic combination of milk and sugar. On a Friday evening, on the fourth floor of Aquamarine apartments, a building whose facade was painted in compliance with its name, two men—Senior and Junior (the former, true to his name, was born two days, eight hours, and 16 minutes before Junior, whose official birthdate was settled by official records, after some wrangling from his father’s side, as October 16)—woke up from their siesta. As the two crawled their toes into their slippers with the same precision, Senior felt a backache running vertically, whereas Junior felt it horizontally. The walls of their flats were too far apart to chatter among themselves, but they absorbed the long and slow wails of Senior and Junior, elegant as equine tails at rest, calling their wives to make them a cup of coffee. Junior, who still had more hair than Senior, ran his hand over his scalp, in the same way Senior did to ascertain that he was no longer dreaming. As Senior stepped out into the veranda, Junior looked to his left to watch Senior take a step of a similarly modest measure to lean against the railing. Junior followed Senior’s glance, which gazed over the hordes of college students that filled the air with their rumorous footfall. The two men watched the youngsters dancing and singing along to pop music, sipping beers from glass bottles, oblivious to the sunset in the distance, waiting for others to join them for an evening of frolic and abandon. But Senior and Junior held the same opinion, privately, about where the others should be looking.",

In the center of the city, the maghrib rang out its ancient melody, warring with the Tamil music lilting out of the speakers of a passing rickshaw—the ocean swell of strings, the buoyant theme of an old Hollywood film. The aroma of filter coffee boiled up from the terraces of the cafes, which were filled with tourists from Tuscany, Madrid, Tyrol. In other neighborhoods, children rendezvoused with their peers in shady alleyways, holding tense diplomatic summits over their games of tag. The heat lingered over the city like a sinister spirit cavalry, a battalion of jinns casting spells over Elliot’s Beach; over the twin harbors and colonial promenade; over the government center and the inland districts; and back out again to one sea-green apartment building, on the third floor of which there were two empty verandahs. In the corresponding room, two men simultaneously awakened from their afternoon naps and stepped out onto these verandahs, which it should be said were no longer empty. Senior and Junior, as the men were called by their respective acquaintances, did not look at each other; nor did they watch the youth wander lazily from the streets to the promenade, passing marijuana cigarettes down the line like the world’s slowest relay team. Senior and Junior looked out at Elliot’s Beach, this strange sandy coin that had been cast away by fate.",

But there were still definite traces of life—beetles that scuttled about licking up dots of water from rivets in aged tiles, vines that wrapped up and through the sides of the canopy built to allow proprietors to gaze at a view without being at the mercy of the cruel sun, thickets of brush with twig-like branches that lined the path to the long-sealed front doors now grew unwieldy and sharp, as their nature demanded. But so too, prominent, were the signs of abandon. A pack of Belga cigarettes, the faded packaging promising style and mystical aura, lay on a patio table. If one listened in the silence, one could almost hear the smacking of thin European lips that may have once suckled the tobacco while remarking about the grand African sun or commenting on the foliage. But the sound would soon be drowned out by the noise of a country that had moved on to larger things—where words like \"reclaim,\" \"rebuild,\" \"remove\" erupted out of automobiles, cafes, town halls, meeting circles, makeshift stages, military bases, parliament buildings, and where, yes, perhaps, there was still space for the word \"resort,\" but only if used in the phrase \"last resort.\" And so the empty building sat, bludgeoned by the naked sun, waiting again for peace, for purpose.",

The moldings decorating the façade betrayed nothing either, except perhaps the usual negligence, the fine patina of dust that came over everything in Africa. But in its interior courtyards, in its once-ornate villas and lush gardens, where the Crown’s servants had dealt out their decks of cards atop white tablecloths, nothing stirred. A grim silence overwhelmed the resort. The grass yellowed under termite-ridden bedframes and writing desks; around them, rags of newspaper and littered correspondences. Vague ink-stains remained on these pages; and a sentence that, ten years ago, could martial an army from one corner of the empire to another was now indecipherable. A pack of “Belga” cigarettes had survived free Africa, escaped the line of white and Asian refugees at the docks, the inevitable mutiny and the mutiny after that. It lay sedately on a bench. For years, its odor would not leave the wooden slats; and in its slim shape it carrie the vestiges of wet, European summers, trails of water from the pool to the bar, the rattle of ice in a tumbler, liveried black boys sweating in the corner, out of sight and at hand. There had been no native plants, no local liquors, no reminders of Africa at the resort—except its conveniences. The brand of cigarettes, of course, was extinct; the company had settled into ruin when its directors left on the outbound ships. The cigarettes were manufactured, now, in the countryside, by Africans; everybody smoked, and the sky slowly turned gray.",

Beige African sidewalks collect debris, chairs in the European style and English books. You can pick up a discarded packet of Belga cigarettes and step into another time, trespass on the resort in its antebellum years. You see then the whole discarded era, Europeans on holiday attempting to make a home of your home. You may traipse through the relics spilling from sidewalk to grass, but you are walking on both. Now it is a place hung between that past and a present that has not shaken what came before. Children from town tell stories about the resort, what it was and what lives there now: ghosts of both the travelers and the locals who worked in the lobbies and kitchens when the building retained its purpose, ghosts in luxury clothing inappropriate for the climate and ghosts in neatly pressed uniforms. The older teens climb inside through gaps in the boarded windows and explore the detritus, daring each other to venture deeper and deeper down unlit hallways smelling of mold and dust. They speak in whispers. This small entertainment is laced with the petty danger that emanates now from the building. You can call it a harmless thing, a relic of before: before the departures of the whites and the Asians, before independence, before the mutinies. Yet the building, an ugly shell of itself, persists. It says: “But here I still am.”",

Inside, there were ten twenty-dollar notes, totalling a sum of two hundred dollars, the most generous amount I had ever received from my father. I thanked him profusely, but it seemed like a prologue to the real question my father wanted to ask me. He invited me to Disney World, where he was planning to take Chitra, his new wife, and my two half-sisters, Rupa and Piu, during spring break. But I felt distant from his new family, like a string being pulled from both ends. I fabricated some excuse about having to be on-campus during that time since I was a Resident Assistant, and declined his invitation. Later that week, as we sat on the floor circled around the Christmas tree in our living room, Rupa and Piu expressed their disappointment. They could not understand why I would not want to join them in Disney World. \"It's Disney World,\" they exclaimed. But I kept thinking of my late mother, and everything I owed her. I felt a responsibility to hold back, to stay with her memory, as if her place in our family was still untouched and unoccupied, in the same way that Rupa and Piu symbolized and remained committed to their father’s legacy. Besides, I felt, with a strange ease, that Chitra and my father, too, were relieved by my decision to leave the four of them alone to enjoy their holiday.",

But he continued explaining, and all the while his eyes remained trained on his girls, who were prostrate under the tree. First, he conjured a creased envelope from his shirt pocket, inside which were two crisp hundred-dollar bills, but no note, no card. The invitation to Disney World came next, in that same laconic way. Unlike the cash, it was entirely intangible. Not a ticket on a red-eye to Orlando, not a room at the same overpriced hotel or a paid-for day pass—-it was simply these words: “And of course, you can join us at Disney World, if you would like.” From the kitchen, Chitra added her ringing voice to his: “Only if you want! There’s no pressure.” Meanwhile, Rupa bounded toward me and Piu followed, talking over each other as they hammered out the details.I was still holding the envelope when it struck me that the tree in their living room was new-—a real Douglas Fir, not the artificial tree, which had infused the winters of my own youth, which my mother decorated with the ornaments I made at preschool. “I would love to,” I said, looking at my father, whose eyes remained elsewhere, “but classes are starting up so soon, and with the teaching load this semester… I should work.” The girls crumpled immediately. “But, but, but why?” My father simply nodded his head gravely, as if we had come to a painful, but just, compromise. “I understand,” he said, “I understand.”",

My mother had always sat in the velvet chair Chitra now inhabited and my mother had even donned a similar posture to hers, pert and classic. I tried to mimic Chitra’s smile. Maybe, I said, of course I’d love to, but exams will be especially wicked this year. I don’t expect to have enough time to get away for a vacation. Piu and Rupa knitted their brows, faces falling for a spell, sensing rejection—hadn’t we been getting close? Chitra’s composed smile remained as if painted on her face.

And in this bath of white she was struck by a feeling of unbearable nostalgia for Jean-Marc. Nostalgia? How could she feel nostalgia when he was right in front of her? How can you suffer from the absence of a person who is present? (Jean-Marc knew how to answer that: you can suffer nostalgia in the presence of the beloved if you glimpse a future where the beloved is no more; if the beloved’s death is, invisibly, already present.) During that moment of strange nostalgia at the seaside, she suddenly thought of her dead child, and a wave of happiness flooded over her. Soon she would be frightened by this feeling.

        "MFA": "The whiteness of the drapes and tablecloth invoked in her the uneasy feeling of one blank canvas. Perhaps, there was an absence she wanted to forget. Her former husband had taken her to such seaside restaurants. But it wasn’t the absence of captured life that stirred in her some unrest but the anticipation of life, of color becoming, the canvas waiting. Even in colorful pockets of her vision–out the deck window to the yellow lampposts and dark ocean–it all bathed in the moon’s white glow. Opaque, the blurred background of a photograph. Yes, a photo, something calling back something that had been. And what of her life now? Why did now pass her as every prior moment had, leaving a feeling, for feelings to be the dropped breadcrumbs of life in its constant evasion? She was struck by an intense nostalgia for Jean-Marc.But how can one feel nostalgia for something — or someone — who sits merely an arm's length away?“Perhaps it’s the grief,” Jean-Marc said. “Your mind is preparing you for loss. Is it not easier to wrap these memories in a protective cloak of nostalgia?”If it was all for impending loss, then her mind was well acquainted. But it wasn’t grief she felt when she thought of her son. She imagined him swinging around the pole of a lamppost. Like breadcrumbs, she happened upon joy in the world’s dark vast woods. Feelings were given, never made. Her child was dead. Her husband was gone. Jean-Marc would one day be gone. And yet.",

Such beautiful, pure things! Yet she was experiencing an odd nostalgia, a longing for this moment even as she sat in her chair within it. She thought the feeling meant: life will never get better than this. The future was her and Jean-Marc, together, but older, and recovered from the mania of fresh love, or perhaps not together at all. But how is it apprpropriate to feel nostalgia when he was right in front of her ? (Jean-Marc however had the answer: the more intensely we love someone in the present, the more we grieve their inevitable absence in some imagined future.) But she did not think that was what she meant at all! The mention of death made her think of the child. The child, forever a child, existing without complication in her death. The solidity of this shot her through with pure happiness. She felt afraid; she clasped her hands together in her lap and said nothing more. How easy it is to reign in our words and actions! But then there is always feeling, loping around like an untrained dog inside all of us, aware of how much we long to leash it.",

It suddenly struck her that everything in the seaside restaurant was white: the deck, the table, the lampposts. Even the moon, stark and full, shone unbearably white tonight. Jean-Marc asks: “What is the matter with you, my dear? You are so quiet tonight.” “Nothing really,” she says knowing it is a lie. Something is wrong, but she cannot put that something into words. It is a strange yet acute longing for what is already hers, sitting right there in front of her. Jean-Marc (feeling the melancholy in the air) says: “Nostalgia comes from the fear of losing someone and imagining life without them.” She thought of her child, the only person she had truly lost. The memory struck her with unexpected happiness, followed immediately by fear. What did it mean to feel sadness at dinner with her lover but happiness thinking of her dead child? Was there something wrong with her? Was she a bad mother, a bad person? Not according to Scottish philosopher David Hume. Hume argued emotions are natural and involuntary.

Why I found myself in the aisles of specialty stores, several miles from home. Why I, each weekend, sought a furtherance: going beyond what I had cooked the week prior, with more tools, sauces, and research on what breed of spaghetti I would cook next. I tracked down a Le Creuset stockpot, a pasta roller, an egg timer. I spent too many hours over my stove at home, simmering garlic in olive oil, and over the cutting board on my countertop, chopping onions, tomatoes, basil. Though innocent at first, soon this meal prep encompassed every evening, Sunday through Sunday, and in this way I practiced what I now call my Spaghetti Days. During this time I never shared a meal with anyone else, coming to believe that spaghetti, along with my evening earl gray and caesar salad, was best enjoyed alone. Soon I realized it wasn’t desire that brought me to the habit, but ritualistic necessity. It was about hands, and what it meant to keep them moving.

Back in my apartment, the experimenting began. What I lacked in formal training I had to make up for in creativity. I cooked feverishly. The smell of garlic was in my hair; the smell of onion was in the carpet; the smell of olive oil was in the wallpaper. Spaghetti sauce consumed me and the place I called home. It even spilled into my dreams. It was very important that I only ate spaghetti alone. It’s the kind of dish that insists on solitude. Before I knew it, I was following a new routine.

But it rattled hollow around the pot. I kept walking until I reached the foreign supermarket with its crates of imported tomatoes under the awning. I put some tomatoes in that pot along with white onions, garlic, oregano, a green glass bottle of olive oil, and boxes and boxes of dry spaghetti. This, for me, was the start of a deep ritual. Steam from the boiling water fogged my kitchen window as I imagined having guests share my tea and salad. They’d comment on the nuance in smells and praise my subtle changes with the sauce and spices. But an audience would have been too much, too cramped and restricting. Spaghetti was best enjoyed alone. And being alone, there were always leftovers I’d scoop into a plastic container. At the end of the week, when it couldn’t fit any more spaghetti, I emptied all of it into the trash.

Fortuitously she sat some feet away from where I stood in line at the counter, crossing her ankles neatly beneath her in the French way, and at last I could admire a charoite skirt and matching cinched blazer that met the milky skin at her thighs and neck. The whole of her became a river to me then, or perhaps instead a lioness paused to drink at cool water; soon, I knew, she would be gone, and the springtime warmth and vibrancy brought by her into this terminal would fade to match the great blank whiteness of snowy winter beyond our shared space.

There she went, distant now, turning left at the junction down the hall, heading in the same direction I soon would--there was still a chance. “Is love at first sight possible?” I asked the clerk when my turn came. He smiled. “Anything else is impossible,” he replied.",

She was dressed with subtle taste: a lynx jacket, a raw silk blouse with very delicate flowers, natural linen trousers, and shoes with a narrow stripe the color of bougainvillea. ‘This is the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,’ I thought, when I saw her pass by with the stealthy stride of a lioness, while I waited in the check-in line at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for the plane to New York.She was a supernatural apparition who existed only for a moment and disappeared into the crowd in the terminal.It was nine in the morning. It had been snowing all night, and traffic was heavier than usual in the city streets, and even slower on the highway, where trailer trucks were lined up on the shoulder and automobiles steamed in the snow. Inside the airport terminal, however, it was still spring.I stood behind an old Dutch woman who spent almost an hour arguing about the weight of her eleven suitcases. I was beginning to feel bored when I saw the momentary apparition who left me breathless, and so I never knew how the dispute ended. Then the ticket clerk brought me down from the clouds with a reproach for my distraction. By way of an excuse, I asked her if she believed in love at first sight. \"Of course,\" she said. \"The other kinds are impossible.\"",

Her skin was dark and glowed with youth, her eyes were clear as a glacial lake. She wore a garment of gold and red fabric that looked as though it came from a culture that was entirely unfamiliar to me, and I stood for a long time admiring it, as though in a trance. Her look suggested an aura of antiquity, and she moved in grace like a lioness, striding confidently across the bright, balmy terminal that contrasted with the snowy world beyond its walls. In a moment, she was gone, her presence as fleeting as it was alluring. I took my place in line, and for a moment I found myself distracted by an elderly Dutch woman who took it upon herself to argue with the ticket clerk about the weight of eleven suitcases, “I’ve weighed them at home,” she said, “they can’t possibly be more than 10 kilograms—” and by the time I reached the front of the line I found myself in a pensive and dreamy mood. Who was that woman of such incredible mystery and poise, whose eyes shone so brightly? Smiling, I asked the ticket clerk if he believed in love at first sight. He laughed and replied that of course he did, how could he not. \"Anything short of this , would be impossible\", the clerk said.",

The fact is that Robbie and Cecilia died during World War II. Robbie succumbed to septicemia at Bray Dunes, and Cecilia perished in a bombing at Balham Underground station. Neither of them knew that I had committed a terrible wrong against them both. In my youth, I was wickedly jealous of Robbie and Cecilia and resented the affection they held for one another. Not because I desired either of them, but because I was angry and lonely and hiding in a bunker of cynicism. I was a postboy, and when Robbie went off to war, I would intercept the letters he sent to Cecelia and slide them into the rain-filled gutters. I did the same to Cecelia’s letters, and their correspondence slowly dwindled. Eventually, they stopped writing to each other altogether. I’ve been approaching this all wrong. Now is the time to let Robbie and Cecelia survive and be together, even if only in these pages. Telling the truth wouldn’t do any good, because it’s an ugly truth.

They died alone, a fault I must now agonizingly take the blame for. It was my callous childishness that ripped Robbie from Cecilia, but it is my better nature that has prompted me to write them a better ending. They find each other again, they live, and they are happy. What good would it do, I beg to know, in telling the foul truth? I’ll tell it, here and now, if only to prove my point. I never saw either of them again that year, how could I, after what I had done to Cecilia? Their love died with them, isolated and unfulfilled, with the sole evidence they ever so much as knew each other being those romantic letters preserved only in a war museum.

All year I have been keeping time by last year’s calendar: what were we doing on this day last year, where did we have dinner, is it the day a year ago we flew to Honolulu after Quintana’s wedding, is it the day a year ago we flew back from Paris, is it the day.

December 31, 2003 was the first full day I was a widow. Those memories remains sharp, regardless of if I’d prefer them smudged.

        "MFA": "When I think of John now, whether in grief or joy, time makes a mirage of our parting. Memories are distant, those vibrant, vivid images inevitably softened by the passing days and nights into muddy and distorted reflections. My practice of keeping time in relation to what John and I were doing last year is a game of questions. When he was alive, who did we see today? Where did we go together? Above all: What did he say to me then? Crossing Lexington Avenue in the wintry haze enveloping New York, a cold, damp curtain hung above the city, I come across the date—December 31, 2003—and realize John never saw this day last year. My exercise for keeping time has expired, and my husband lives in the distant past. I might transplant him here, invite him as memory into this moment to maintain our profound connection, the sort unsevered by death so long as he is kept within the perfect safety of memory. Yet it occurs to me—in this exercise of resurrection, I am only ensuring that I, too, never see December 31, 2003. That I, like John, live only in my recollections. Thus: we must keep them dead. To continue living, to draw oneself up from the smudged and mildewy twilight of the place where memory is real to us, there can be no resurrection; for the living to carry on, the dead must remain dead.",

For a while, I was able to maintain a handle on reality by way of an elaborate method of timekeeping. It was calming to look back at what John and I were doing one year ago, and keep track of the days that way. One year ago today, I would remind myself, we were in Mexico, preparing a dinner of heavily spiced chicken in our rented kitchen. One year ago today, we were at the Met, looking at the new rooftop exhibit, which John loved but I disliked for its uninspired crudeness. These memories were vivid, acute, and I was able to almost watch them, like one would a television show. And then, December 31, 2003 arrived. In that moment, one year ago no longer included him. John had morphed, officially, into a part of the past and not the present. I came to this burning realization while I was crossing Lexington Avenue. I had a bag of groceries in my hand. It was snowing, quite faintly. I realized I had spent the year trying to keep him alive, because I have always believed, been told, that it is our duty to keep the dead alive. But what about the living? I realized it, then, that the key to all of this was to keep them dead. There was no other way, in my view, to continue living myself.",

It was a fine instrument that had been passed down from my grandfather to my father to me. Both of these men were long dead, and it seemed that in my inheriting the watch, I had inherited their fate: the impending loss of a war with time. It was a fate my father had tried in vain to prepare me for.“Time,” he once said to me, “is inexorable. It can be fought, but never conquered. Our victories are as futile as our struggles.” Time was and is and had and always would win. All I could do was lay in bed and listen to the steady, measured thump of its advance, like the footsteps of an army unafraid of being spotted by its enemy. The ticking seemed to stop coming from the watch. Now, it was coming from everywhere. Time bled from the walls and windows and floors, and with the flood came memory. I thought of my father describing Jesus walking along long and lonely light rays. I thought of his stories about St. Francis’s “Little Sister Death” who left no flower un-plucked. The waters of time rose and roiled around me. I wondered if I would be able to float, and as swiftly as the question came upon me, so did its answer. Time would rise; I would sink.",

My father talked about the dark in a similar night’s stifled room. How Saint Francis welcomed Little Sister Death as the dark all around Jesus when he walked along the long and lonely light-rays. Beyond that dark is nothing but dark, that we only know dark from the little light we got. We only know time because we count it, but countless time goes unticked in the unending dark, so much time there is no before, no after, the unnumbered breezes with no curtain to shape them.

They almost had me then. But I would not let them. No I would never let them. Not once. Because once is always. And the ticking hiccups of my grandfather’s watch that my father gave me in my pocket I could not either escape. Its rhythm beating hiccups against my leg made me think only of my father and every word he ever gave me to hold on to. The inescapability of clocks never outweighed by the conquered, momentary kingdoms of victories, he said, never outdone by wordly doings done in the face of all that we are faced with. These are but illusions and facades in the battlegrounds of time, he once said. But consider Jesus walking forty days forty nights and the long and lonely light-rays and consider even still Saint Francis’s Little Sister Death, consider the weight of Jesus and light and death, he said.

The tight and winding corridors were not unlike veins, but rather than blood and life, all that ran through them was darkness. Hill House was not sane. Rather, it was a place where reality wobbled and warped into something unrecognizable. And now Dr. John Montague had come to cross the threshold. A Doctor of Philosophy in anthropology, Montague had dedicated his career to the study of supernatural phenomena. He was a reasonable sort of man who insisted on his own soundness of mind. He was stubborn and dogged in his pursuits, but always shuffled shyly around the fringes of academia, insecure about the reputation he had built for himself. He clung to his title of “doctor” with ferocious pride and brandished it like a badge at the slightest hint of skepticism from his colleagues. His ultimate goal had always been to find a genuine haunted house: a place that would offer up evidence so absolute that there could be no room for argument. It was a tumultuous and often disappointing journey that had, at last, led him to Hill House. After several fruitless grant applications for his proposed experiment on psychic disturbances, Montague decided to make a personal investment in the project and rent Hill House using his own savings. The cost was significant, but so was Montague’s belief that it was well worth the price.",

Dr. John Montague was the latest resident, a man far more foolish than his doctorate in anthropology would lead one to believe. His path of study brought him not to the study of people, but deceased people. Dr. Montague considered himself an expert in paranormal happenings, a fact that left him with few peers. Academics shunned him, and he shunned ghost hunters. Formally organized academia needed to be inserted into the field of the supernatural if there was ever going to be a proper study done, and Dr. Montague was more than willing to use his credentials to move things along. Renting Hill House came at significant financial cost to Dr. Montague, but he was quite certain that this was the avenue that would lead him to career success. No one could look at Hill House and dismiss that it was a truly haunted house. Dr. Montague had researched the house himself and found its past riddled with the occult. Once he conducted his study and produced a paper that could double as a guidebook to the paranormal, the checks written to rent the house would cease to matter.",

There she is, a human being, diving into the unknown, and she is wide awake.",
        "MFA": "Reva seemed distant the last time we talked, though maybe I’m just imagining that now. She was breathing heavily into the phone when she picked up. It sounded like she was having sex, and I made a mean joke about it, and she laughed in a forced way and told me she was at the gym, on the elliptical, which I could imagine easily, her in that ugly little workout set, climbing toward nothing. She told me she’d call me back later, but she never did. Then she went missing after 9/11, and I knew she was dead. Not in any kind of mystical or spiritual way, but because I knew there was no other option. That same day, I bought a TV/VCR from Best Buy with cash because I wanted to record the news coverage. Now, I watch it, not in a morbid way, but hoping I’ll find a clue, about something, maybe about Reva, maybe about something else. It’s not about Trevor anymore. He’s in Barbados on his honeymoon, probably slathering sunscreen on his anorexic wife and pretending to be happy. Or maybe he is happy. I was watching one of the recordings today when I spotted something. From the smoking North Tower, a woman poked her torso out of a window. She was wearing a blue sweater and jeans. She had brown hair, short like Reva’s. She hovered on the edge for a moment, then let go and plunged into the unknown. She sailed weightlessly through the air, and then she disappeared out of frame.",

        "MFA": "I’d spoken with Reva last week, but it was a short conversation filled mostly with platitudes. She’d seemed distracted and said she was at the gym. When the news broke about the towers, I called her a few times, but she didn’t pick up. Without thinking, I went immediately to the store to purchase a TV/VCR machine. Suddenly the most important thing was to record all the news footage that was blaring at me from out of my TV. I thought briefly about calling Trevor, then remembered that he was in Barbados on his honeymoon, probably sipping a drink with some spiky, inedible part of a fruit in it, completely unaware of what had happened. Once the sun went down and I still hadn’t heard from her, I realized that Reva was lost, likely for good. For days I sat watching and rewatching the footage I’d taped of the attacks, unable to move from in front of the TV save to piss or search the bathroom cabinet for more pills. There was a video of a woman leaping from the North Tower, and though it was too grainy for me to ever be able to tell if it was Reva, I liked imagining that it was.She wore a grey pencil skirt with black tights and stilettos – one still gripping her foot while the other had torn free, suspended in the air. She looked so beautiful, jumping like that into the unknown, that I took a kind of strange and holy comfort in her courage.",

        "MFA": "The last time I spoke to Reva, she was distant. Eager to get back to sweating on the elliptical, or stair-master, or whatever absurd machine she was convinced would keep away the horrors of arm flab. She’s distant now, too, but in a new way. That day, Trevor was on his honeymoon in Barbados, but Reva felt farther. She was gone, lost. I still feel a faint throb of theft when I think of them. On the morning of September 11th , I bought a TV/VCR and recorded the towers going down. When I find myself drifting, floating back to the state I had been in that previous year, I turn on the recording and watch. The footage isn’t soothing, it’s scalding—it wakes me up and keeps me conscious. In one clip, my favorite clip, a woman leaps from a window ledge in the North Tower. She looks enough like Reva that if I were feeling sentimental, I could pretend it’s her. The edge of her pencil skirt whipping up could be Reva’s knock-off designer, her shoes flying from her feet and floating up past her head could be Reva’s second hand Manolos, the glints of sunlight that could be Reva’s grandmother’s ring. But it doesn’t have to be. I don’t need her to be Reva. In dreams, when you feel like you’re falling, you jolt awake. I need her to wake me up.",

The subject roused and pantomimed closeness, holding Orin’s clammy ribs, giggling at nothing, suggesting they fry or filet or bake the byproducts of various animals for breakfast. Orin’s beady little button eyes shimmered the reflections of the Subject's own eyes, through which they saw, perhaps, a glimpse of their own happiness, their own attempts at it, their own failures towards it. Orin longed to be alone, to return to his routines. Four coffees, each more burned than the last, a shower where he contemplated cleaning the mold spots that grew imperceptibly over the evening, perceptibly over the month, and perhaps a run after to justify the next day’s shower.

It’s always the same thing for him, that feeling of being wrenched out of a bottomless pit, the spiders, the heights, the tsunamis, the teeth falling out and clattering to the floor, the cliché and the boilerplate, dreams and fears so ordinary and yet completely destabilizing. He wants to go through his ritual, the multiple black coffees and the boiling hot shower and the run around the block in his sweatpants, just to get to a state resembling normalcy. But on this particular day, he has woken up next to a Subject, and he feels that rage, at the person he was last night, and also at the person lying in bed beside him. He has been doing this more and more lately, finding somebody to go to bed with, and he always hates himself for it. He wants to go back to the heights and the spiders to avoid the cuddling, the mindless small talk, the fried eggs, the depressing attempts at morning sex, the way the Subjects are chronically unable to recognize his torment. When he is alone, he feels suffocated, but with the Subjects, it’s worse. He wants to go back to the tall building he was teetering on the edge of the moment before he woke up, though now he feels, strangely, like he is already there.

Orin’s constructed a number of morning rituals to mitigate the queasy, sucked-out feeling his dreams give him, which rituals have grown more repetitive and elongated with time, such that he now needs to drink multiple cups of coffee, have two or sometimes three showers, and go on a run before he feels even remotely normal. On those mornings when he has a Subject still in his bed from the night before, and therefore for obvious reasons can’t indulge his full routine, he finds himself privately ruminating on his disturbing and repetitive nightmares while he and the Subject are cuddling, chatting or cooking breakfast together, all while she remains totally oblivious to his tormented internal state. So that paradoxically, waking up next to a partner actually makes him feel even greater discomfort and alienation than if he were alone. Though make no mistake, mornings alone are almost unbearably oppressive, even the routines do little to alleviate Orin’s dread of the day ahead, the coming day seeming to him alternately like an insurmountable vertical climb or yet another fall from a great height.",

Where the blind man was going Holme had already been, and Holme wondered then if anyone had informed the man of the grimness of what lay ahead at the end of the road.

The blind man acknowledged him with a smile, though Holme was standing still and had offered no greeting. The man’s shirt was stained rust red. Has anyone told him? The irony was dark and clean. Empty too as was everything else. He was tapping his cane on to nowhere. Holme let pass this sign of life on a futile journey. Was it better to know? No, a gift to be unseeing.

A cold wind howled through the vegetation and the mud grew deeper until he reached a point where setting his boot in the mire Holme felt it sucking on his leg as if into a deep bubbling pit. No way forward. He retraced his steps. A while along the way he’d come he encountered a hunched old man tapping his way down the road with a stick.

She saw the man’s face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, “Why you’re one of my babies. You’re one of my own children!” She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. Then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.Hiram and Bobby Lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child’s and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.Without his glasses, The Misfit’s eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. “Take her off and thow her where you thown the others,” he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.“She was a talker, wasn’t she?” Bobby Lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.“She would of been a good woman,” The Misfit said, “if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.”“Some fun!” Bobby Lee said.“Shut up, Bobby Lee,” The Misfit said. “It’s no real pleasure in life.”",
        "MFA": "The Misfit looked at the old woman who had risen on to her knees in the damp grass and begun to pray. Hearing the familiar words made him lose his sense of urgency for it recalled to his mind the prayers he had memorized and repeated as a boy. The promise of redemption had appealed to him then but as a grown man he knew to trust only those things he could see for himself and verify firsthand. He would have given anything to have proof of his own everlasting soul or anyone else’s, but no sign had ever revealed itself to him and so the promises had turned curdled and turned bitter in his heart. The grandmother watched the Misfit’s face change as she prayed. She saw him illuminated and transformed into a young child, long before he was ever a killer, with a soul as pure and innocent as her son’s had once been. “You’re one of my own children!” she cried and reached out to him. But the sudden flicker of her outstretched white hand made the Misfit recoil and shoot. He shot three times in quick succession until she had crumpled and fallen back into the ditch. He stood over her in the ditch and watched her lips settle into a faint smile. He removed his wire-rimmed glasses and used his handkerchief to wipe the flecks of blood off them. Without the lenses his eyes were pale and defenseless and he let them pass over her lifeless body once before he replaced the frames and turned to Bobby Lee and Hiram. “Bury her with the others,” he said. “Boy, ain’t we havin’ some fun today?” Bobby Lee hooted, but the Misfit cut him off. “There’s no real pleasure in life,” he said sharply and walked back to the car.",

        "MFA": "Home, that perennial thing. The place we’ve heard a million aphorisms about—telling us how much it matters, that it’s always there for us, and trying to answer the biggest question: where to find it. Thomas Wolfe’s novel, You Can’t Go Home Again, seems to offer a concerning counter to this, but this is actually a trick of the light, for one can never truly leave home to begin with. Home is in the sinew, in the flesh, home, in all of its shadows, dreams, fears, and dragons, is a place deep in the bosom, straight in the center, right up the spine and down through the feet. And what is truly at the core of home is not the wood beams, the forest hills, the patio furniture, metal gates and paved roads—it’s the youthful perception, those rose-tinted glasses, a time of understanding before the world laid its full hands on us. It is childhood, not just the memory or the idea of it, but the physical self that was once to a child, learning the way of the world, ignorant to the ways of man, the race, the place, the pace. It is a version of the self that navigates only through imagination, through interaction with those mysterious figures of the land, the adults, the mailman, the clerk, the aunt, the neighbor, the siblings. And it is this version of the self, the child, that we try to run to when we get older when the bills pile, when you can’t find a place to park, when the kids won’t listen, when we crave that time again, that little pocket in our chest we can tuck into to know that there was life before these little bothers. When we nestle in there, we find the key to ultimate return, to a place of comfort, to belonging to your own world— to coming home.",

        "MFA": "Though I understand the meaning behind ‘You Can’t Go Home’, the title of that great novel by Thomas Wolfe, I myself cannot agree with his sentiment. I have found myself returning home many times over the years. There may no longer be a geographical place that bears more than a passing resemblance to the home of my girlhood, yet “home” itself is something inescapable and internal, a place of shadows, dreams, fears and dragons that is formed in childhood and carried deep inside for the rest of one’s life. I have returned again and again to that place, an imaginative landscape mapped and defined not by geography nor by cultural differences but by our youthful perceptions, during a time when the adults in our lives—parents, neighbors, siblings—are but shadowy figures whose actions are an enigma to us even as they shape our very selves. Many of us will grow old without truly growing up. We may fulfill the roles demanded of us as we age, whether by paying a bill, finding a parking space, or any of those actions that comprise an adult life. We may wander to other continents and may never return to the physical houses of our pasts, if these houses even remain standing for us to visit. But we are always one moment away from retreating to this inner world. It is here where we immerse ourselves in the comforts that defined our sense of home as children, whether those comforts were real or half imagined and exaggerated by our childlike innocence. I have returned home in spirit countless times, to this inner world that is a refuge and sanctuary, a place of ultimate belonging. It is this home which keeps me whole, a place I will never fully leave.",

        "MFA": "I imagined him taller than he should have been, his head near the ceiling of an unfamiliar apartment he couldn’t love as he wrote his novel You Can’t Go Home Again looming over his refrigerator. Home, to Thomas Wolfe, was a quiet town in a temperate valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains. From such vantage points, the world becomes diminutive, entirely comprehensible. Only when you venture into those views do you see the world’s vastness beyond its landscapes, how you can’t see home through eyes that have left, that have taken in new views, new worlds, a new you. But can home be truly gone without you? Is home not a dark chamber you carry within, with its shadows, dreams, fears, and dragons? I remembered my childhood home for the woods that circled the property, where things belonged because they resided there. A childhood home is the childhood. It is the wilderness unknowing children frolic through. It is the security of a warm blanket before they learn it can be ripped away. The adults in their lives seem impossibly, staggeringly old, years beyond the years children know. Like enigmatic peaks of mountain ranges, parents, older siblings, and neighbors loom from a distance. They cast only shadows on the sunny region of play that is the childhood home. But the sun falls and the shadows grow long. With time, the children grow taller than they should, than they feel they should. They leave the wilderness. Through the vague groping around in the night to their parkings spaces and their dinner tables strewn with bills, they long for childhood, for return. But as sure as that longing pulls from within them, there is that dark chamber waiting for light. It has always been there. You have never left home.",

No, I wasn’t going to make her spell it out, and she went on, saying that she had gotten quite impatient about the whole thing. She was ready, she said, and she wanted to bow out while there was still time. My friend’s body had never fared well when it was invaded by illness. It also didn’t fare well when it was invaded by medicine. As a teenager, she had lots of problems with headaches. Stomachaches, too, but she didn’t talk about that as much. She was also allergic to many things. Of dying, she said this: I want it to feel natural, without anything getting in the way. She wouldn’t say how this would happen. Just like the coming of the Lord, nobody would know until it was already here. I had two main concerns. One of them was practical—if I came to stay with her and supervise her wellbeing, my mail would pile up. The other was that I found it unthinkable to ask her any direct questions. Questions like, when? Questions like, where? My friend insisted on secrecy and made me promise not to tell anyone about her plan, and especially not about her drug of choice. She said this would bring her peace and give me protection. To be honest, I did want both of those things. But sometimes I can’t help myself. I told someone without even meaning to.

Would I have to look after her things and live with guilt? It would’ve been different if my friend didn’t want to handle “her situation” on her own terms. She, who had always been a planner, had even decided which drug she wanted to use to die, and asked me to keep it a secret, both for her sake and for my “protection,” whatever that meant. What concerned me though was that she wanted to do it soon. She said it slowly and calmly, but her tone was riddled with impatience and readiness. My friend had been ill for a long time and her body had not been responding well to treatments. She had spent so much in hospitals that now she wanted death to feel natural, without any interventions or disruptions. Smooth and clean. She hoped death would arrive like an unexpected guest. “Like the coming of the Lord, you know?” she said, with a laugh. I was in two minds. I wanted to know when she was planning for it all to go down, but it felt unthinkable to probe directly about her timeline. And, I felt equally concerned with more practical issues. If I were to stay with my friend during her final days, my mail would pile up. What would I do then? And what would happen to everything she had? It was all this and more about her, including her choice of pill, that I recounted to another friend of mine later in the day.",

Her hands: frail, slightly shaking. She is ready to die, she tells me, she wants to get it over with, it feels like that's the way her body is heading. All the ups and downs with the treatments just delaying the inevitable. She's bound to die, just like the coming of the Lord is bound to happen, she says. She glances upwards and my eyes follow hers.

He rose up from his knees, a man rewound–the dramatic act reversed, so that again he became just a man with a lockbox of feelings. Just Ennis, slumped against the valley.

Nothing ended, nothing begun, nothing resolved.",
        "MFA": "“You the storm that stranded me here,” said Jack. “Ain’t no other way to put it. I been thinkin on it, bustin my brain to try and fit the bits together, but it’s bullshit. You know it is, Ennis, don’t pretend like you don’t. I’ve called you, sent you letters first class, and you actin like the offseason applies to us. Brokeback’s just a little vacation, a couple ranch-hands in heat. Maybe you like it like that. You sure got me on a short leash. That’s all I am to you, Ennis: a bitch for the summer. I’d swallow glass if it meant I could spend the rest a my life on Brokeback, but you won’t even pick up the goddam phone.” Jack looked at the ridgeline. “I wish I knew how to quit you.” Ennis got down on one knee, and for a second Jack thought he was tying his shoe. Sobs wracked his ribs. “Jesus!” yelled Jack. Ennis kept crying. He looked down at the earth, the denim of his knee stirring up dust. To Jack he looked like a wounded horse, its hooves at rest. He feared for Ennis, this man for whom he had stored up so much love and hate. A cold distant man making a scene on the roadside—it didn’t make much in the way of sense. Jack had more to say but his jaw stayed shut. Ennis sobbed. After awhile he went still. Ennis pulled himself to his feet and pushed the dust off his jeans. Jack looked at him and Ennis looked back, but there was nothing there. Just the clouds of steam rising.",

        "MFA": "Kant wrote thirty versions of his coming-out email over the course of ten months. Though he knew better, he couldn’t keep from anticipating and meticulously addressing, in the email itself, the various surprised, dismissive, or condemnatory responses of his friends and family, to the point where the email was less an act of claiming his own reality than a bullish bracing of himself against an incoming bilgewater tide of others’ realities. He clicked send. Feeling noble, self-satisfied, and above all ready, he camped at his laptop with an energy drink and spammed refresh. A couple hours later, an email from his father sent a spike of fear into his chest: he was about to be disowned. But while not exactly celebratory, the message indicated uncomplicated respect and acceptance. An email from an old college friend came in next, composed only of emojis. Where was their disgust? Their bitterness and disdain? The underwhelm was itself an overwhelm: he felt ridiculous, mocked by precisely an absence of mockery. Coming out should feel like something, shouldn’t it? He considered, by way of analogy, his own naïve expectation every birthday that he might experience an inner shift adequate to the day’s significance, a radiance, a spiritual lift, some kind of internal popping sound at least—I’m twenty-nine!—and instead met again and again just another day. Wasn’t this exactly how all life’s big events felt? A non-feeling? Supportive replies rolled in, and each refused to move the plot of his life forward. He’d imagined that this one symbolic action would release something huge and wild in him, that he’d start going on dates, he’d kiss the real flesh of a real guy; but months later he was still eating the same Cheez-Its and masturbating to the same porn, only now he didn’t even bother to clean up after himself. What he’d imagined calling The Year of Freedom had become The Year of Damp Feet.",

        "MFA": "For seven months, thirty-one-year old Kant tried to come out. He had decided that the most optimized method would take the form of mass email, as text could be perfected, and, in these many months, perfected the text he had done: it was nearly a work of art, forthcoming without oversharing (he’d received feedback from internet forums), and grammar checked. It was four sentences. He’d created a listserv for the recipients: family, friends, and coworkers. After he closed his eyes, downed two shots of vodka, and hit “send,” he knew what was going to come to him. His colleagues would whisper about his deviant sexual activity; inevitably, he’d get kicked out on the street with his box of desk supplies (a dried-up fern and a hand gripper). Not to mention his poor mother—her wracking sobs, her inevitable refusal to speak to him, the prodigal son, ever again. After sending, he paced around the room, drank four additional shots, and cried in the bathroom. By the time that he’d finished the anxious rigamarole, a few replies had come in, and the reality became obvious: he’d been received with open-arms and heart emojis. His boss, Greg, replied: “Great for you, bud.” On the phone, his parents told him that they still loved him; in fact, they’d thought he might’ve been—well, not heterosexual. In the days after he’d sent the email, he didn’t feel compelled to download any apps or sit at a stool in the gay bar down the street. A part of him wished for adversity, or at least the accompanying opportunity to rise above it, but he was left with an understanding that nothing had changed, that declaration didn’t always inspire action. Instead, he spent the rest of the post-coming-out year taking his lunch to-go and eating at his desk, lifting dumbbells in front of “Housewives of SLC,” and referring to it as “The Year of Damp Feet,” meaning he went straight from the shower to the bed without toweling off.

        "MFA": "Kant writes the email and spends a long time editing it, making minor changes to the wording only to change them back to exactly what he’d written before. He thinks about his upbringing and all the years that this information has weighed on him: the kids in middle school who tackled him in the locker room and forced him to eat dog shit, the fact that he couldn’t even admit to himself that he wanted to watch gay porn until he was twenty-five. Paralyzed, still editing, he imagines his mother’s disgust upon reading the email, imagining her 31-year-old son doing exactly what he’d done for the better part of the last two decades: that is, fanatasizing about some buff, hairy dude he saw online. He imagines himself dying alone, ostracized from anyone who might love him, the nerves in his dick beginning to desensitize from too much dry-hand masturbation. When he sends the email, though, the responses are surprisingly anticlimactic. He gets a few heart emojis from friends; some coworkers reply with “nice,” and “good for you!” Even his parents are mostly supportive, though his mom expresses some mild annoyance that he hadn’t called first to warn them. Kant feels a mixture of intense relief, combined with an unpleasant sense of disappointment that he finds difficult to face. Where was the fallout, the dramatic messages and cut-off relationships from family members? Why didn’t anyone care? He had once imagined his post-coming out life as a time of transformation, a new life like a beautiful patterned carpet rolling out before him, but instead he finds himself stuck in the exact same state of stasis that emboldened him to write the email in the first place. He begins to call this period his “Year of Damp Feet,” as his feet are constantly sweaty despite the fact that he rarely moves them from beneath his computer desk.",

Clarissa thinks of his letters, the glint in his eye she can still feel in those pages — his promise, too, steady as his voice, to return from India, to return and to see her. Cauliflowers! Such a thing to remember as clearly as if their breakfast was shared only yesterday, when in fact yesterday Clarissa had been deciding about the flowers, deciding to buy them from the yellow and blue shop she now rapidly approaches, with the vibrant window displays; the freshest flowers, she knew, those with the richest and most enduring smell, must come from this shop, and now she would buy them herself.",

Outside, it was almost Bourton—the air was sharp, like a country wind, she thought; at eighteen, in Bourton, it had felt more like a gale; yes, at eighteen years old, simply placing one foot in front of the other had lent Clarissa purpose—a stroll around the garden was as grand as an expedition to India. Yes, at Bourton, the thought of sending Lucy would not have arisen; Clarissa would purchase the flowers and admire them freely. But in London, a strong wind carried the brine of the Thames; it stank; it irritated her lungs, her heart; the odor of the flowers would, too. And there came Peter Walsh, sailing in on an airy, unnamed ship, saying, “What match is a cauliflower for a man?” (Around his voice, Clarissa recognized the faint crunch and tinkling of a decade-old breakfast.) Peter will return from India like that—on which date and at which time his ship would dock in England should have been unimportant to Clarissa, and yet she wondered; she called up his last letters, filed away in a familiar groove, and read them again, and with each word, London decayed, fell away like petals, and in its place, she erected another cathedral.

        "MFA": "The scent of blossoms colors the night, and New York in its entirety fits very neatly and completely into my hands. For instance, between my thumb and my index, lights flicker on and off in a miniature window. If I elongate my fingers I could also hold the silver skyscrapers tearing into the clouds. How astonishing; the skyline’s ants and beasts fit right, and wrong, into my palms. Back in my father's village nothing, absolutely nothing, fit into my hands. There were no neat edges anywhere, no contrast, nothing for me to want to try to hold. In short, there is no place I feel less alone than here, alone on this bench in New York, where the skyline is ours, and we are the skyline, my eyes staring straight into the material manifestation of a second person plural. In the future, they will say this skyline was synonymous with every art, every intimate form that has ever, or will ever, exist. To say we are the skyline is to confirm a collective identity, to confirm a stake in what makes up the city's sublime marrow; bundled debt, traces of antidepressants in the water, traffic networks, and shifting weather patterns. As an artist it will be my mission to transmute bad forms of collectivity into a sculpture of the communal body of the future. There is something Noor said once, in response to my ideas about the fiction of the world, that I am desperately trying to forget. We were not speaking the way people speak, necessarily, but more like skies, or skylines, when a passing cloud whispered something about a mirror. The disembodied voice said one cannot recognize oneself and at once be identical with oneself. But one plus one plus one equals three, if my math is correct. So maybe we multiply, keep multiplying, and our past and present and future selves never leave, and maybe that is what Noor really meant when she said the world has no genre you can name. The midnight air does nothing to unflatten my hair beneath the bandana. I would mistake this moment for a dream if I had not just consumed an irresponsible quantity of unsulfured mango, the juice all over my fingers. I vaguely remember a dream of myself as an old man, maybe an old woman, my fingers free of both tiny windows and the stain of fruit, and with this memory of the future I experience a mild lacrimal event, and I feel very alone, and very together.",

        "MFA": "I inhale the night, which has the faint taste of blossoms hanging on it. I always found it thrilling to watch the city this way, how the illuminated windows on apartment buildings and offices cling together as parts of an expansive and profoundly intricate skyline. The beauty others find in a mountain, a valley, a crested hill, I find in looking at urban mosaics like these, like Manhattan, this grand forest of buildings and bridges and smoke and air. I find that nature feels too much like a singular entity, a crystalline cohesion, whereas urban landscapes feel like a second person plural, something that does not exist now, but exists only in the future, a future where everything, art and intimacy and joy and expansion, has room to breathe and move. It’s almost unbearable, the sublimity of the bundled debt, the anti-depressants that stream through urine and into the water supply, the light pollution, traffic in the sky and on the ground, all connecting to create something artful and strange and united. This is what I think of when I gaze at the skyline, how I will become an artist, one who transforms and reshapes bad modes of collectivity into the possibility for good, into a broad future where all entities can exist in the same body. I think of Noor—how can I not?— and my connection to her, her connection to us all, her large and shapeless body, which the fiction of the world organizes itself so perfectly around. I am alone. I am alienated. And I am the alienator—I have no false pretenses about this. How ironic it feels, sometimes, to know that I am alone, and yet not even identical with myself. Is it foolish that I find some hope in that? That I think of Noor and I feel her and I smell the blossoms of the city night and I understand that the past and present are formless, shapeless, and can be reorganized, reimagined into something bigger? I sit here and I look at the skylight. It’s midnight, and I am on a bench that’s cold and, I think, slightly damp, though it’s hard to tell. My eyes are blurry with exhaustion, my hair flattened by that blue bandanna from Goodwill, and I am eating an irresponsible quantity of unsulfured mango from a Ziplock bag.

During the war years, when I was still a grade school boy, this was a magical name in our Newark neighborhood, even to adults just a generation removed from the city's old Prince Street ghetto and not yet so flawlessly Americanized as to be bowled over by the prowess of a high school athlete. The name was magical; so was the anomalous face. Of the few fair-complexioned Jewish students in our preponderantly Jewish public high school, none possessed anything remotely like the steep-jawed, insentient Viking mask of this blue-eyed blond born into our tribe as Seymour Irving Levov.The Swede starred as end in football, center in basketball, and first baseman in baseball. Only the basketball team was ever any good—twice winning the city championship while he was its leading scorer—but as long as the Swede excelled, the fate of our sports teams didn't matter much to a student body whose elders, largely undereducated and overburdened, venerated academic achievement above all else. Physical aggression, even camouflaged by athletic uniforms and official rules and intended to do no harm to Jews, was not a traditional source of pleasure in our community—advanced degrees were. Nonetheless, through the Swede, the neighborhood entered into a fantasy about itself and about the world, the fantasy of sports fans everywhere: almost like Gentiles (as they imagined Gentiles), our families could forget the way things actually work and make an athletic performance the repository of all their hopes. Primarily, they could forget the war.The elevation of Swede Levov into the household Apollo of the Weequahic Jews can best be explained, I think, by the war against the Germans and the Japanese and the fears that it fostered. With the Swede indomitable on the playing field, the meaningless surface of life provided a bizarre, delusionary kind of sustenance, the happy release into a Swedian innocence, for those who lived in dread of never seeing their sons or their brothers or their husbands again.",
        "MFA": "I was a boy of World War II and a boy of Newark. The war was far away and beyond my understanding, but the dread and threat of it spilled across the ocean and flooded every home in my city. Lots of our men were off fighting, and lots of them would never come home. Rations of oil and sugar were dispensed through clenched fists. We spent many nights huddled around the radio and forgetting to breathe. It was a time of need, which is—according to the comic books—the perfect time for a hero to arrive. Newark’s wartime hero was a high school boy named Seymour Irving Levov, who we nicknamed “The Swede” because of his blond hair and blue eyes. He was a paragon of greatness in my neighborhood, and his athletic ability was the stuff of legend; regardless of the sport he played, he always clinched the win for his team. The Swede’s consistent excellence in football, basketball, and baseball gave my community something to rally for. Being Jewish, most of us tended to prioritize academic achievements over physical feats, but the Swede changed things. We’d turn up to his games with homemade banners and clumsily invented cheers, among them “S-W-E-D-E, get this team to victory!” Watching the force of his kick, the graceful arch of his throw, and the shattering power of his swing shrouded us in a feeling of awe that was rarely experienced outside of Temple. When the Swede was on the field or on the court, my whole neighborhood was in the palm of his hand.

Looking back, I don’t know if our hero arrived or if our hero was created, but the Swede was more than willing to shoulder the burden.",

        "MFA": "In Newark, the war was a permanent fixture—at the dinner table, in the classroom, everywhere. But I was just a pimply and unsettled boy, and my understanding of the war was somewhat opaque. What I remember most about that time is not the constant barrage of terrible news or the hushed conversations about the Germans, but rather a boy, well, a young man, named Seymour Irving Levov, though we all called him “The Swede,” because he looked about as Nordic as they come with his white-blond hair and his blue eyes, all the Jewishness rinsed out of him at birth. He was beloved, and it was strange the way he was beloved, because the favorites in the community were usually the smart ones. And The Swede was smart, sure, but it was his athletic prowess that made him godlike, his speed, his strength, the effortless way he wound his arm back to crack a baseball through the air. You could feel it when he weaved around the basketball court, the way the crowd tensed and relaxed and oozed as one entity when he climbed through the air toward the hoop, the wing of his shoulder blade bringing him higher, higher to victory. I was preoccupied with other things; I was not afraid of the war but I knew they were. I could see it on their faces and in the way they held their purses tighter, the way their lips began to turn down when they performed mundane tasks, my mother folding laundry with a look of terror on her face, my father driving to the grocery store, his hands so tight around the steering wheel that his knuckles went white. The Swede became a symbol of innocence and invincibility to them. He was our Apollo, a religious totem you could hold tightly and press to your lips in those dark hours of the night.Watch us in the stadium, in the football field stands, as he dove nose-first into the end zone. You would have seen a group of people utterly unafraid.",

I wasn’t trying to out-duel him, that would have been impossible; it was an effort to get closer to his prestige, even if I could never match it. In Newark nobody did what he did. He was striking for many reasons—the blue eyes and fair hair that gave Seymour Irving Levov his nickname wasn’t common in our synagogue. He also carved out a niche in our world we found both bizarre and entrancing. While most of us studied and read till bedtime The Swede must have spent the time lifting weights and punching swinging bags of cotton. In school he excelled in football, basketball, and baseball while we watched with fearful hope. His curled muscles and firm abdomen seemed to defy the laws of our upbringings, of our parents’ schemes, but also to create a new sort of hope, because World War II was underway and surely The Swede could deliver a personal victory against the Germans not only militarily for the United States but for Jews in Newark too. His youth gave him a wide-eyed stupid confidence and his figure gave him an invincibility. He was our Apollo. With every snap of the bat against the ball, we cheered for him and for our brothers and fathers in the war who might just come home safely if they could channel The Swede’s fiendish affinity for dominant physical triumph, a kind of triumph none of us were used to seeing embodied. He spun through defenders on the basketball court and we imagined Newark’s finest darting through enemy lines toward us. He dove into the opponent’s running back and we imagined our male relatives tackling a Nazi and pounding, pounding, pounding down, breaking them into specific wet bits we could never have seen in such luscious detail otherwise.",

        "MFA": "When I started living at my father's place in New York I couldn't stop crying. The weeping would be long and drawn out, dramatic affairs, and through my vision blurred with tears I would see my father's awful furniture, everything wooden and overly embellished, and the ugliness of the space I was in would only make me cry more. Often as I cried, I would think about how my he told me about Thelma Rice. What made it all the more horrible was how utterly mundane it was. I was looking through Sam's little bookshelf for something to sing him to sleep. I was on autopilot, already thinking about what I would do after Sam fell asleep. I was not scrounging through my husband's letters, or stalking Thelma on the streets. I just pulled a book at random and flipped it open to the first page and there, in the most flowery, idiotic handwriting, a note: for the man with a mouth do a lot more than singing, love, Thelma. Disgusting, especially because it was a children's book, one that was on my son's bookshelf. Just thinking about her handwriting could make me cry for twenty minutes. To make myself feel better I would think about how ugly she was. Not very women's lib, I know, but she was my husband's mistress. And she was ugly, it was a fact. She had these bulging eyes and a veiny neck and nothing about her face was symmetrical. I would think about that and stop crying and then think about that note and the whole cycle would start all over again. In public, I put on a brave face. One night I went to dinner and at one point I said, no one wants to take out a lady who's seven months pregnant, she'll eat twice as much! It's not very funny when I write it down. When I said it, though, people laughed. Although, now I wonder if they were laughing because it was funny, or because they pitied me. I was certainly quite pitiable.",

Like a villain in a Roald Dahl book. Imagine my shame, telling people I had been cheated on, at thirty-eight, with a woman named Thelma Rice? I would have gotten him back, I really would, but it’s difficult to date when you’re seven months pregnant. That’s a joke. I’m laughing as I write it. I admit that it feels sad when it’s on paper. The laughter I can hear now is the worst kind: sympathetic laughter. The truth is, I don’t laugh often these days. I cry and cry and cry. I cry in a lot of places, but I do most of my crying in my father’s New York apartment, surrounded by that mocking cuckoo clock and all the uncomfortable plastic furniture. But there is laughter. How can I not laugh when I think of the moment I found out? Sitting on the floor of the nursery, amongst the blocks and the plush toys, cherubic Sam on my knee, opening that children’s song book I found out later was a gift to my husband from Thelma called “The Hungry Hippo.” On the first page, in lascivious handwriting: My darling. Let this be a reminder of how hungry I am for you. xoxo- Thelma. I remember the sound as I snapped the book shut. I remember Sam grabbing for it, wondering why story time was over before it had begun. I can see her when I close my eyes, hunched over that sweet and unassuming book, a hippo herself with that round, smug face, those manly teeth, that grayish skin. To be cheated on when you are seven months pregnant, by your second husband, is one thing. To be cheated on with a woman who resembles a cartoon hippo is entirely another. This, more than anything, is what makes me cry when I’m alone with just my father’s cuckoo clock and the rubber loveseat to keep me company.",

Thelma Rice does not understand the struggle of dating inherent to being a 38-year-old pregnant woman, though maybe one day she will! It's a thought I comfort myself with, and it makes me laugh. I miss laughing. I don't think the joke would make anyone so much as giggle, not when said out loud and especially not when I look at it written on paper. It's just pathetic, I can hear the awkward chuckles now, the kind clusters of people make when trying to be sympathetic, or to prevent tears. I'm crying now, but I'm pregnant so it's to be expected. My life has turned quite ugly, filled with droll tragedy and my father's hideous furniture. It's good of him to let me stay in his New York apartment, but the place is so grey and miserable that it makes me grey and miserable. The lights in all the lamps flicker, and the few windows face a brick wall, so the apartment resembles a cave more than a home. It's fitting, I suppose. A nice cave, buried deep in the building, where I can retreat to lick my wounds. If my father's apartment had looked like a real home, I would have been reminded of what I lost. Ever since I found that crude inscription, in a book of children's songs of all places, I've had no home. Thelma Rice, with her endless entitlements, dragged Sam into this too, scrawling out her wantonness on the pages of a book suited for a small child, not a grown man. I can just see her now, her short and stubby fingers clutching at the pen as she tried to rhyme words together into her approximation of a clever lyric. I imagine her chewing her pen with her crooked teeth and smudging her lurid lipstick down her chin. It makes me feel...better, to think of her this way. Like I can see her truest self.",

She had short hair, and her breasts were small for how big she was. Her eyes were thin and suspicious. She opened the door when I came to put her mail in the box. She wore a white, lace robe that was meant for a smaller woman, and it made her hips look nice and round. She was smoking a cigarette delicately like a movie star, and she asked me to give her the mail. I did, three letters, and somehow we ended up talking, and I found out her husband was stationed somewhere in California. “It’s sorta dark, the loneliness,” she said, and I agreed with her. “You’re alone?” she asked. “No,” I said. “But you’re still lonely.” I shrugged and looked right at the sun. We organized it so we’d meet that night, at her house. It was her idea, but I didn’t exactly turn it down. I went over there after dinner and it was nice enough. We fooled around on her couch and I was pleasantly surprised by how good her figure was. She wasn’t all lumpy and stretched like big women can be. It went on like that for a couple nights, but by the third I was tired of it and that was the end of that. It was a good experience, all in all, and reminded me why I liked that job so much.",

Until she opened her mouth and gave me her sad sap story. Her husband was enlisted some place far away. I couldn't tell what possibility bothered her most—that he was blowing guys' heads off or that he was getting blown. She went on and on about how it wasn't right for a married woman to be all alone. The big diamond ring was apparently a cure-all. This was news to me. I had a lady, myself, but I was lonely with her.After our shift, when the big woman invited me to come over later that night, I thought, to hell with being lonely ever again! The sex was great, the kind you think about the next time your old lady \"has a headache\" and you're on your own for the night, but not great enough. Five days later I found her to be so one-note that I split. Besides, even when we were together, we were both still alone.

        "MFA": "The elevator opened onto the third floor, and I flattened myself against the side as a patient and his doctor exited. “Dr. Y from Respiratory Medicine,” said the intercom. On the fourth floor, two nurses entered the crowded elevator. As I was forced into the corner, I heard “Dr. Y from Respiratory Medicine” bleat over the intercom again. I had two more floors left before I’d reach hers. Whether Dr. Y from Respiratory Medicine appeared or not, I had a plan, infallible and precise. I would see her, lying prone on her hospital bed, and hold up the bag. “I have to apologize for everything,” I’d say. “I made this bag for you. I crafted it myself.”“How lovely,” she’d respond, her voice lax from the painkillers. “How many pockets does it have?”“Six,” I’d say. “What material did you use to stitch it together?” “Cowhide. It feels like a baby’s cheek. Feel it,” I’d say. “Please, feel it.”When she reached out to touch her finger on the belly of the bag, I’d lean over and, taking my shears out, throw away the hospital linens covering her body. Then, as her hand caressed the bag’s soft skin, I’d cut into her chest. I’d trim the strings of the heart first, the extraneous vessels and tissue that fastened it to her insides. Once it was freed, I’d toss the shears aside. Then I’d grasp it with my bare hand. In my palm, her heart would fit like a baseball. After it was done, I’d leave, my bag in hand, alone. “Dr Y. from Respiratory Medicine,” repeated the intercom. As another nurse shuffled past me, I clutched the bag to my chest. Its delicate construction couldn’t dull the shears hidden inside. Their blades were so sharp that, when the elevator moved upward once more, they pricked me. The elevator dinged for the sixth floor.",

I slip myself between the heat of their bodies, which are all dressed in blue gowns or white coats. I press the button six. A voice comes on over a speaker hidden somewhere up above. “Dr. Y from Respiratory Medicine,” the voice says. It repeats the words as the elevator whirs into motion and begins to rise. I wonder where in the building Dr. Y could be. I look down at the bag in my hands, admiring my fine craftsmanship–the softness of the leather, the straight, simple lines of my stitches. I have made it for the woman exactly to her specifications. It is undeniable. “Look,” I will say. “Look what I have made for you. See how beautiful it is?” I will offer it to her to try on. She will be grateful, of course, and in awe of the beauty of my hard work. She will try it on, adjusting the straps to her liking. She will arrange it this way and that: cross-body, or dangling from her fingers, or slung carelessly off the shoulder. “Do you trust me again?” I will ask. In the face of the beauty of the bag, she will have no choice but to say yes, to be nothing but thankful. And then, after she has given me her trust, I will take out my sheers and use them to cut out her heart. The heart and the bag will be mine alone to claim. My grip tightens on the sheers that I keep tucked behind the bag. The blades are long and sharp. They are a silver so bright that it flashes in the glare of the overhead elevator lighting when I sneak a look down at them. The elevator dings; we have arrived at the sixth floor.",

I joined the patients and visitors that grouped in another. The doors closed, and the elevator began its ascent. The tightly packed bodies offset the hospital's sterile smell. I had been told that I would find Rin on the sixth floor. I clutched the bag I brought for her, made heavy by the shears within. I wondered if she'd notice the care I put into making her bag the same way I noticed the care with which she used to tend her shrubs. Before her accident, she'd rise early to trim them, and I could see her from the window of my workshop. Watching her felt almost voyeuristic at first. The precision with which she used her shears excited me, reminiscent of the delicate way I stitched my handbags. We rarely spoke, but perhaps watching her in this way made me envy her. I had seen her work, but she had never seen mine. I planned to present her with the bag, one of the best I'd constructed, as a gesture of good will in hope of regaining her trust. I would politely request she accept the bag, and see if she admired it the way I admired her shrubs. Then I would remove the shears. I imagined that revealing them to her, while she was in such a helpless state from her injuries, would cause alarm. After all, I could easily plunge them into her, trim around her chest like one of her shrubs, and cut away her heart. She'd be helpless to stop me, and I could claim the bag I made for her alone. \"Attention: Dr. Y from Respiratory Medicine, telephone please. Dr. Y, telephone please,\" a voice over a speaker said.

A woman who shouts down men who try to dominate her, a woman who refuses to ever be under the thumb of a man and shows up at all the right marches and always has her pink pussy hat at the ready for whatever protests comes next. I see those women, and I respect them, and often, I want to be them. But the fact of the matter is sometimes when men try to dominate me I let them, so they can mow my lawn without much of a fuss. When my father rattles off five misogynistic things in a row on our phone call I am silent, because I am too tired to fight back. And sometimes it is too cold outside to protest, pink pussy hat or no pink pussy hat. I want to be a good feminist, one that believes that women can do anything by themselves and we don't need any man. But sometimes I long to be cared for, sometimes I think I really do need a man. I long to be soft and weepy, and wear long flowing dresses and lipstick. This is the type of women the patriarchy praises, and feminists despise - and sometimes that is the type of woman I want to be. I want to be a good feminist, but often I am a bad feminist. I like dancing to rap songs with lyrics that are categorically misogynistic. I like wearing pink and scrolling through Pinterest pictures of those 'perfect' women that I know are there to make all us regular women feel terrible about ourselves. I like wearing those long maxi dresses that make me look like I could be on a farm, tending chickens and popping out babies dutifully for my husband. Not only do I like wearing those dresses, but I even have opinions on those dresses -- there are certain prints I love and other prints I find gauche, and when I see women wearing the latter I judge them. Another thing a good feminist would never do. And yet - I believe in the equality of the sexes. I am against male domination. I love women, and I want women to thrive. I just refuse to step up onto the pedestal of 'good feminist'. If I did, I'd fall. I'm a bad feminist.",

        "MFA": "To be a feminist — perhaps, to be a woman at all — is to teeter on the edge of a chasm between principle and performance. This week I rode the subway for the first time in months. In a moment of hyperperception, I swept my awareness over the scene: dusty bottles at the edge of the track, a lone rat scurrying into the bowels of the public transit system, three men hulking at one side of a gum-stained bench, blasting Drake on a tinny speaker. I found myself acutely aware not only of my perception of the scene, but of the men’s perception of my perception of the scene, and my perception of the men’s perception of my perception. Was I to admonish these men for listening to an artist well-known for wrapping misogyny in a catchy tune and feeding it to vulnerable audiences of young, troubled men? Did they expect this of me —were they waiting for my reprimand, already preparing their rebuttal? Should I be bracing myself for a flurry of calm downs and lighten ups? I did none of these things. Instead I found myself nodding slightly to the beat. Because, to tell the truth — it was a catchy tune. Perhaps this makes me a bad feminist. Perhaps I am a bad feminist for wearing pink flowy maxi dresses that highlight my femininity, a choice in line with the beauty standards and fashion requirements long used to subjugate women — to make women seem weaker, more delicate, more frivolous. Perhaps I am a bad feminist for ceding, at times, to this perception of the feminine as frail and foolish when it conveniences me: allowing a gallant male stranger to change my tire on the side of the road or letting my professional persona slip in a rare moment of vulnerability. Perhaps I am a bad feminist for thinking any of this at all — by discounting my true nature, I am participating in the classic erasure of women’s personal desires in favor of the welfare of others. Perhaps I am a bad feminist. But I am also a tired feminist. Where does it end? Am I to be trapped forever in this infinite moral calculation of every action and every thought? Candidly, I don’t mind being a bad feminist, if it means I can be like the subway rat — revolting and dirty, maybe, but free to scurry at my whim.",

        "MFA": "At one time I imagined that being a desirable woman made you an object and being an undesirable woman made you a person. In the years since I’ve learned that being an undesirable woman actually makes you less than a person, makes you something subhuman. If you are a woman but not a beautiful woman, are instead a fat woman scorned by men and more largely scorned by a society that understands women as objects subjected to male desire, then you are not allowed to be human. And this is me. Not quite a human because of the body I live in. This realm is where my own bad feminism is seen again and again, in my understanding that there is no right way to be a woman, no way to be a woman and live an uncomplicated human existence, put in conflict with a desire to be a woman who is allowed to be. When I think about weight loss, about changing myself so that I might live in an uncontroversial body, I see in this transformation some proof of concept: if I can be normal, if I can be accepted in my body, then my life will be made significantly simpler. The thin woman is a woman who is allowed to be a woman. These fantasies border phantasmagoria, bad feminist rhetoric equating internal change with external corroboration. What does it mean, then, if I long for independence and long also to be cared for, to surrender to care. If I want to present myself as a professional and want also to be vulnerable, to handle my vulnerability as a weapon. This, too, tied with physicality—to want to look like woman, wear pink and enjoy fashion, and simultaneously live as a professional who critiques beauty standards asking women to starve themselves into shadows and silhouettes. I might listen to rap with inherently anti-feminist lyrics, I might wear pink skirts and loathe maxi dresses made for thin bodies and thin bodies alone, and I might hate myself for all this—I may find myself mortified by these choices, by the bad feminist implications therein. But none of this posturing, none of these feelings, exempt me from the womanhood I was born into. There is no good feminist, I could argue. There is no way out. If you want to be human, you cannot also be a woman.",

It was coming down in buckets. Even barrels. My hunting hat helped protect my hair a little, but I was soaked all the way to my bones. I didn’t think I’d ever get dry. But even though I was cold and wet, I couldn’t stop feeling so happy that every raindrop was like a miniature sun. I watched Phoebe laughing and waving in her blue coat. She was smiling real big, and after a little while, I realized I was smiling too. The painted horses on the carousel went up and down, and I didn’t want them to ever stop. Then I ended up here, where nobody smiles like Phoebe and I’m not allowed outside by myself. It doesn’t rain very often around here, but when it does, I sit by the windows and remember what it felt like to stand in that crazy downpour. Then I smile just to myself, like a secret. Everybody here asks me the stupidest questions I’ve ever heard. Especially that one doctor. He asked me the other day about whether I plan on applying myself when I go back to school. “That’s none of your goddamn business,” I said to him. “You’re right,” he said. “It isn’t really my business.

I think he should worry about wasting his own potential. What kind of doctor wants to be stuck in a place like this talking to people like me? Sometimes my brother D.B. comes to visit.

Mostly stuff about medicine, which I don’t like talking about, and television, which I’m not even allowed to watch here.

I mean it was really raining—my shoes started to get soaked, and my hair, but watching her atop the fake little ponies I only felt an overwhelming sense of joy. There was my sister, in her blue coat, laughing and riding on the carousel without a care in the world. I stood there in my soggy shoes for a while just watching her; my hunting hat protected me slightly from the rain, but mostly I didn’t even mind how wet I was getting. I was just so happy watching her there. Really I think that was one of the last times I can remember feeling happy without anything else getting in the way. Later, once I arrived in the facility, I remember the psychoanalyst there asked me some stupid question, something about my future—whether I would start to finally apply myself in school or something. I never knew how to answer dumb questions like that, so usually I’d stay quiet or say something snarky in reply so that they learned to stop asking. Sometimes D.B. would come and see me, which wasn’t so bad, except for the fact that he was always rattling on about his screenwriting career and asking me more stupid questions. “Isn’t there anything you’re passionate about? Anything at all?” I remember once, he came to visit me with this actress woman he had been seeing. She was really glamorous, and I remember she had said she was from England, or maybe I’m just thinking that because she had this snotty-sounding accent. She didn’t really ask me any questions; she mostly just sat there and would speak if D.B. spoke to her. Anyway, there was one time that the two of them came to visit me, and I remember that once the actress went to the bathroom, D.B. leaned in and asked me what I thought of everything that had been going on. “What do you mean?” I asked him, annoyed to have to field yet another question. “I guess I just mean—all of this,” he said, and he stuck his hand out to gesture all around us. I realized then how pointless it had been to share anything with D.B. in the first place, with him or even the one's I didn't like—Stradlater, Ackley, Maurice. I kept thinking that somehow, I’d figure out a way to help them see things the way I did, and then we’d finally understand each other and I wouldn’t have to explain anything anymore. But in the end, all it did was make me feel more alone.",

        "expert": "Boy, it began to rain like a bastard. In buckets, I swear to God. All the parents and mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel, so they wouldn’t get soaked to the skin or anything, but I stuck around on the bench for quite a while. I got pretty soaking wet, especially my neck and my pants. My hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection, in a way; but I got soaked anyway. I didn’t care, though. I felt so damn happy all of sudden, the way old Phoebe kept going around and around. I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn happy, if you want to know the truth. I don’t know why. It was just that she looked so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all. God, I wish you could’ve been there.That’s all I’m going to tell about. I could probably tell you what I did after I went home, and how I got sick and all, and what school I’m supposed to go to next fall, after I get out of here, but I don’t feel like it. I really don’t. That stuﬀ doesn’t interest me too much right now.A lot of people, especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here, keeps asking me if I’m going apply myself when I go back to school next September. It’s such a stupid question, in my opinion. I mean how do you know what you’re going to do till you do it? The answer is, you don’t. I think I am, but how do I know? I swear it’s a stupid question. D.B. isn’t as bad as the rest of them, but he keeps asking me a lot of questions, too. He drove over last Saturday with this English babe that’s in this new picture he’s writing. She was pretty aﬀected, but very good-looking. Anyway, one time when she went to the ladies’ room way the hell down in the other wing D.B. asked me what I thought about all this stuﬀ I just ﬁnished telling you about. I didn’t know what the hell to say. If you want to know the truth, I don’t know what I think about it. I’m sorry I told so many people about it. About all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about. Even old Stradlater and Ackley, for instance. I think I even miss that goddam Maurice. It’s funny. Don’t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.",
        "MFA": "It seemed to me that it had never rained that hard. I might as well have been out in the next great flood with all that rain, but I didn’t mind. Watching Phoebe in her new blue coat go round and round on that shiny carousel horse made me feel so damn warm, that I hardly even noticed the cold wet of it all. My hunting hat shielded me a bit, but that got soaked fast. In no time at all, I was drenched. Totally soaked, but totally happy, too. I could hear Phoebe laughing on the horse, and of course she wasn’t wet under the carousel’s awning. She seemed to me completely free. I guess I could have gotten upset, shivering as I was and my clothes so heavy with water that they were falling off of me. My shoes squished when I moved even a little, but I felt like a million bucks watching Phoebe. The happiness didn’t last, though, not through to right now. I’m stuck in this miserable “rest” home, where I can’t even rest. How am I meant to relax when these idiot psychoanalysts keep pelting me with idiot questions? One of them badgers me with nonsense like, “But how do you expect do have a future if you don’t care to maintain your present? You need to try in school. Do you intend to try in school?” My brother, D.B., the screenwriter, likes to visit and ask me mind-numbing questions, too, though he’s not nearly as bad at the psycho- babblers. He’s not so bad because he’s my brother, and I do love him, so I tolerate the million- and-one questions, but I still wish he’d cut back on the interrogations. He brought this glamorous actress, a Brit, to visit with him, and while she’s off powdering her nose or whatever girls do in the bathroom, D.B. asks me: “How are you feeling, champ, about everything that’s happened?” I tell him, slowly, the details of the last few days. It’s strange to say it out loud, rather than just in my head, where I can say whatever I want. But it’s nice, too, a relief, even. Telling D.B. about it makes him lean in close to listen, and I feel close to him, not just physically but emotionally. Like my brother is really with me. Talking about Stradlater, Ackley, and Maurice, it feels like they’re with me, too. I don’t even like those guys, but talking about them makes me feel…surrounded. I don’t think I’m a happy person, but talking about when I was happy, with Phoebe, I feel like I could be.",

        "MFA": "There came a point in my life when I seemed to have to \"prove\" my Blackness, despite my inherent identity as a Black man. As a result, I joined the Black Panther Party in college. I needed some validation that I was, indeed, who I appeared to be, not only on the outside but on the inside as well. Both Blacks and whites alike told me that I was \"not Black enough\" for them (they saw the way I played basketball, muttering \"Egads\" under my breath with every foul or missed layup—Egads). This applied not only to my physical appearance and manner of speech but also extended to my intellect and my books.My most recent manuscript was denied by every major publisher. From a reviewer: \"While somewhat compelling and an interesting take on the retelling of Aeschylus, we just don't see how it relates to the Black experience.\" Despite my being a Black writer, the book was, apparently, not written from a Black perspective. At the latest New York literary party, a well-known literary agent told me, \"You should forget those retellings of yours; classical works aren't what the market is looking for. What we're seeking are the true, gritty stories of Black life—write that, then give me a call.\"I told him, \"My stories are Black stories.\" And in their own way, it was true. Was I not a Black writer? The agent shuffled past me to attend to a performance artist so they could see what they could do for one another, before never speaking to each other again.I didn't know how to contend with any of it: how to portray myself as \"Black enough,\" the backward, ill-feeling guilt behind not being so, and how to fit into the mold that society made of Black men. We all had to be gangsters, rappers. But why should I have been anything other than who I was? Race was a construct I didn't believe in and rarely dwelt on, until those moments arose when guilt compelled me to see the \"other side\" of the matter. I saw its real-world consequences: police brutality, discrimination, violence. I didn't know if that meant I was supposed to take part in any of it.",

        "MFA": "I remember those college days. The grass peeking over cement, the columns of the buildings thick, stuffed, presumably, with knowledge. Though, admittedly, I had a hard time juggling it all, having joined the Panthers on campus, less for their social cause, and more to reject the budding questions about my Blackness. Needless to say, it didn't work. Everywhere I went, strangers, white and Black, would tell me I wasn't Black enough. The white friends wanted to know why I didn't keep a gun, like a real Black Panther, and the Panthers wanted to know why I was so busy doing the white man's homework. Once, an entire basketball court stopped the game to laugh for five minutes when they heard me mutter egads after missing a shot. I can take these teases in everyday life, but when it comes to my literature, that's when the blade cuts deepest. The most recent was a slack-mouthed reviewer who wondered why my last novel, a retelling of Aeschylus, did not portray adequately, as they put it, \"the Black man's experience.\" This was no unusual comment. At a literary party, I was once told to abandon my passion for classic retellings in favor of \"true, gritty real stories of Black life.\" There were millions to be made here, an agent had said. When I refused their suggestion, telling them that all of my stories are stories of Black life, because I, a Black life, made them, they moseyed over to a performance artist, with whom they spent the rest of the evening talking about sword-swallowing. I looked at the paintings on the walls of the luxury Harlem apartment, all of Black strife, contorted faces, hands in yearning, bodies that seldom looked like bodies. Pictures of poverty worth millions. I couldn't say that I believed in race at all - I saw it merely as a construct. And yet, its grasp over me and those around me felt crushing, inevitable, real. I knew if I burned the apartment to the ground, as I felt the growing desire to do, the newspaper would not say \"Established Author Sets Party Ablaze in Fit of Misplaced Justice.\" No, it would simply say, \"Black Man Commits Arson.\" That would be how I would be remembered.",

She was almost at the end when a large figure jumped out in front of her. “You’ve gotta come to the party!” he shouted.

She tried to contain her scream, but it came roaring out of her anyway. She balled her hands into fists and pounded them into the carpet, which appeared to move beneath her, the patterns snakelike and fluid.The elevator made an ominous noise as it crept up the shaft, and she got on her knees, gripping the wall to try and stand. The elevator doors peeled open, revealing Jack with his heavy mallet. He spotted her and smiled. “Those pretty brains,” he said, and staggered in her direction. She began to run again, and he was behind her quickly. She felt the whoosh of the mallet, the air from its force grazing the back of her neck. She ducked away, and watched as Jack’s momentum sent him tumbling face-down onto the carpet, blood scattering like gory diamonds.

At least the thundering of her pulse dulled the pain in her side. She turned corner after corner. Her feet barely touched the steps. The stairs seemed to stretch on endlessly. Finally, she reached the landing. She thought she had a second to breathe, when suddenly, a man—or something similar to a man— burst from a door. He wore a green ghoul mask and his suit reeked of mildew. Blowing a party favor that flapped in the air like a severed tongue, he shrieked, “Party time!” Wendy screamed and not knowing where else to go, stumbled backwards. The man vanished as abruptly as he’d appeared, slamming the door behind him. Wendy’s chest heaved. She collapsed to the floor. Her eyes felt heavy, but she told herself to stay awake, to just stay awake. Beneath her trembling fingers, the carpet seemed to writhe, its pattern shifting back and forth. She heard a ‘ding’ from the elevator. Jack’s footsteps followed. The mallet whistled past her shoulder, but Jack’s momentum betrayed him as he crashed to the floor. Blood splattered in jagged streaks across the still shifting carpet. This was her moment. If not now, then when? Wendy got up, staggered, pain exploding in her side, and started running. Every step felt slow and heavy, as though she moved through quicksand. She imagined Jack rising behind her, unstoppable, coming closer by the second.

Blood oozed out of his grinning mouth and down his chin. He looked like a real maniac, some deranged and bloodthirsty maniac. That gave Wendy the push she needed to block out her pain and pick up her pace. As she reached the next floor and darted through a connected corridor, a door suddenly swung open. A man emerged. He wore a rubbery and ghoulish green mask that seemed to be part of a Halloween costume. “Sing, dance, come celebrate! The party’s just starting!” he shouted, voice booming like a thunderstorm, and pulled the string on a party popper. A crack like lightning. The startling party favor spit confetti into the hallway, and Wendy gasped. The man slammed the door, vanishing back into the room. For a moment Wendy felt ridiculous, as if this whole thing were staged and harmless, like a haunted house attraction at an amusement park. But her body’s brief relaxation brought back her pain, which burst through her side. She crumpled in agony to the floor, vision blurring, battling to keep herself conscious; the carpet moved under her fingers. She heard the elevator rumble again, and knew that Jack had caught up. “There she is! Smile for me!” He lunged at her, narrowly missing her head with his mallet. Too much momentum. He lost his balance and crashed to the floor beside her with a thud. Blood spraying out of his mouth and onto the carpet as his cheek hit the ground. His eyes stayed closed. Wendy’s heart skipped a beat and for a moment she thought it was over. Then Jack opened one eye, almost playfully, and reached for her. She crawled forward, pushing herself back up and into a gradual sprint but Jack’s heavy footfalls trailed not far behind.",

        "MFA": "I’ve realized that craving and fulfillment are not connected in the way I once thought. A craving is so intense and visceral that it cannot be truly satiated by consuming the thing you want. For example, berries are always sweeter before I eat them. I wonder if that’s how Eve felt in the garden after she tasted the forbidden fruit—disappointed, hungry, running her tongue over her teeth in search of satisfaction. I’ve been thinking about Sylvie, and how she disappeared silently into the forest and left me alone. I suspected she might be hiding somewhere, watching from a perch atop a spruce tree or huddled inside a hollow log. She liked to tease me. I didn’t want to give her the satisfaction of calling out for her, making her think I was afraid of being alone. I didn’t want her to feel like she’d rescued me by returning. I meandered around the little clearing and looked at the great towering tree trunks and their long shadows and the patches of grass poking up from the dark earth. In the center of it all, I imagined a statue. She was carved from some kind of pale, luminescent stone, something that seemed to give off its own light from within. Rare flowers were twined in her hair—orchid doves, lenten roses, midnight clematis. Blossoming vines wound up her body, not trapping her, but protecting her. My statue was a radiant mother, utterly unlike the barren, remorseful wife of Lot. She was vibrant and forgiving, always surrounded by children who marveled at her quiet beauty. The children, wild vagabonds of the forest, would be drawn to her through some mysterious summons, and they would huddle before her and bask in her gentle solace. Though her frozen hands would never touch them, she would look upon them with a kindness they had never known, and their happy tears would feed the vines and flowers that had made her their home. When the children were with her, they were not orphans, but children who had been made to be loved by a mother.",

Sylvie had said earlier that in springtime we could pick berries here. I searched for Sylvie's hand beside mine, but I found that she had slipped away silently and left me alone in the clearing. Yet in some way, I felt I could sense her closeness and thought she might be watching me from the woods, so I showed no change in my expression and pretended to be ignorant of my solitude. Around me, the sun cast long shadows through the partings of the tree branches, from which the browned leaves had already begun to fall into the clearing. A thin layer of frost was formed on the mud around where I sat. I imagined forming out of this cold clay earth a statue of a woman whom I would adorn with rare flowers. She would be a calm presence standing among the trees, not the cold, hard pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was transformed as punishment for her desire, for turning back with regret to look at all she had lost. A figure free of yearning, around whom the wild children of the forest would gather to marvel at her beauty and warmth. They would take solace in the vivacious beauty of such a figure and cling to her almost as a mother, even as her frozen hands could not caress them as one would their own children. Again I looked for Sylvie and thought of how I was, in searching for someone who had left me, not unlike the poor woman who had been turned to salt. Unlike the taste of those imagined berries, I was not sure if my longing for connection could ever be quite enough to evoke the presence of the thing itself.",

        "expert": "To crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow. For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing—the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one’s hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries.Sylvie was gone. She had left without a word, or a sound. I thought she must be teasing, perhaps watching me from the woods. I pretended not to know I was alone. I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here. Any child who saw once how the gleaming water spilled to the tips of branches, and rounded and dropped and pocked the softening shadows of frost at the foot of each tree, would come to see it again.If there had been snow I would have made a statue, a woman to stand along the path, among the trees. The children would have come close, to look at her. Lot’s wife was salt and barren, because she was full of loss and mourning, and looked back. But here rare flowers would gleam in her hair, and on her breast, and in her hands, and there would be children all around her, to love and marvel at her for her beauty, and to laugh at her extravagant adornments, as if they had set the flowers in her hair and thrown down all the flowers at her feet, and they would forgive her, eagerly and lavishly, for turning away, though she never asked to be forgiven. Though her hands were ice and did not touch them, she would be more than mother to them, she so calm, so still, and they such wild and orphan things.",
        "MFA": "Sometimes I wonder about the difference between craving something and fulfillment. Sometimes I want something so much I feel like I’m going to break open. Let’s say it’s a fresh berry, let’s say it’s like I’ve been really wanting a fresh berry, plucked from a bush in the orchard, even before that berry’s in my hands, it’s already got a taste in my mind, I’ve been building it up moment after moment until I have it in my brain like I’ve already got it on my tongue, so when Sylvie tells me she picked something for me and plops it in my mouth, it’s even sweeter because the sweetness confirms the foundation I’ve already built for it. I don’t know how to put it. Sylvie disappeared for a while, like a mouse, but then she came back. Sometimes she still goes out though, vanishes into the woods without saying anything. I think she’s out there right now, watching me ruminate. I don’t know what kind of solitude we can both get when we both are in each other’s minds. Could it be a way of being together? A very strange way? It’s beautiful out in the woods. The trees are older than I can fathom, really, old like stories can be old. I’d like to put a status out there, almost like somebody would always be watching, a statue of a woman, to stand in between all those old trees, a woman in a crown of new flowers, looking only ever ahead, forward, never letting any kind of barrenness touch her, like she was the opposite of Lot’s wife and all there was to her was the kind of forgiving vibrancy that children wonder at, the vibrancy that comes from a life well-lived. Even as a statue, I think they’d come to her, every child that’s ever felt lost-wild and orphan, and I think when they’d reach out to touch her stone hands, they’d find that that statue’s stone was warm for them. Sometimes I wish Sylvie were warmer. There’s warmth all around in all the beautiful trees and even the grasses. The problem is that trees don’t feel warm when you touch their bark unless it’s from the sun.",

We were trying to find a suitable convertible and some recording equipment, but none of it was going well. The attorney met me at the Polynesian bar, and I was calling up the company, asking if I could get my good equipment and how soon. They weren't making sense—you could rarely make sense with these people—but the attorney grabbed the phone, and it seemed like soon enough we'd get it squared away. But the car situation was harder; the salesman took one look at us and shut down, as if we weren't respectable people with respectable money. The attorney stepped in again and got it sorted in his sweaty, loud, unpleasant sort of way. Some people just commanded respect. At the equipment store, we were hovering halfway in and halfway out while the salesman, tire irons in his hands like we were common thieves, was trying to get all our information from us pronto, and the motherfucker wouldn't even open the door. I kept saying I was just there for my equipment, and finally, exasperated, he came back with the stuff we'd asked for, sliding it through like a file in a prison cake. Just as we got in the car, we saw a Stingray hit a pedestrian on Sunset Boulevard. Real quick, it happening in a single breath—though I guessed the pedestrian wouldn't be breathing again after this accident. I looked at the attorney, and he laughed, shell-shocked, and I laughed too even though he was driving me crazy. After an hour on the road, he was still driving me crazy in the passenger seat. We did a little peyote and then a little ketamine, and I thought the two cancelled each other out, for the most part, and my foot was flat on the wheel. All around us we saw desert brush and mesas and nothing, the flat orange nothing that lived out there in the desert. Hollywood felt far away then, but Las Vegas felt further, and we hadn't done much by way of preparations for this Las Vegas trip.

We decided we would drive from Hollywood to Vegas, and I began to round up all my drugs—mescaline, amyl, and half a jar of cocaine that I had been keeping in my coat closet for a special occasion. At the same time, I sent my attorney out to look for a decent convertible with a high-quality stereo so that we could listen to music as loud as we wanted while driving through the desert. There were a lot of false starts; for several hours my attorney spoke aggressively on the phone with several car rental agencies while we sat at a Polynesian bar, with me sneaking off occasionally to do hits of acid in the bathroom. He kept needing to demand respect from these salesmen guys who were jerking him around, which I felt completely reflected the energy of Los Angeles at the time… everyone talking over one another and wanting desperately to wring the other’s neck, and yet nobody capable of listening to a single word the other is saying…eventually he got it straightened out, after hanging up angrily a few times and cursing while this ugly group of veins nearly popped out of his neck, and while we drive back to my place we saw a Stingray car hit a woman crossing Sunset Boulevard—she lay there, spread-eagled, and I remember thinking that this was what America had come to now, reduced to lying lifeless among the bird shit on the street. When we finally made it to the store with the audio equipment, things became even more unbearable, everything rushing down on me like a wave made from needles. Through a half-cracked open door, my attorney argued with the salespeople, who clearly wanted us out of there as quickly as possible. They held their tire irons like baseball bats, and I felt scared, but intrigued, although maybe it was the acid making me feel scared…I wanted to know what would happen, and I wanted, more than anything, for the rushing feeling to stop. Back and forth and back and forth and back and forth they went, until eventually, it was over and we started our drive through the desert.",

The car, I realized, wouldn't do at all. It was too slow and too compact. It was terrible. What we needed was a big, rumbling convertible. We stopped for a few drinks at an ugly Polynesian bar, and the attorney made some frantic calls about a new rental, demanding the respect an esquire deserves. He did it. We turned off at a rental joint to turn in our desecrated piece of crap for a nice new Stingray. The salesman haggled with us, thinking we couldn't haggle back under the grip of heinous chemicals. We also required some high-quality recording equipment, which we would find when we finally tore into Vegas. There was something we needed it for, because this was a work trip, and all our expenses were dutifully covered as long as we did the interviews. We tried to enter an electronics store, and the clerk stopped us. \"Go away,\" he said, holding the door shut. He waved a crowbar. The attorney negotiated quickly, sneaking company credit cards through the crack, and shortly after, recording equipment sat on the curb with us.

        "MFA": "Like most people, Walter and Patty Berglund had a past life. Unlike most people, this past life took place in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the Berglunds’ current life in Washington D.C., where they had moved two years prior, Walter was falling from grace. It was perhaps less like a fall and more like a plummet. An article in the New York Times had just been published, ruthlessly exposing his corrupt dealings with the coal industry. These misdeeds included but were not limited to bribery, extortion, embezzlement, and profiteering. In describing Walter, the article made generous use of words like “arrogant” and “ethically compromised,” which Walter’s old neighbors in Ramsey Hill found difficult to process. In their memories, he had been an idealistic, environmentally conscious man who commuted across town by bike even in the most vicious of sleet and hail. Many had once considered Walter to be the embodiment of rural, green values—someone who set an aspirational standard for the rest to follow. It seemed he had experienced a change of heart since leaving town. When the Berglunds first moved to Ramsey Hill, they worked doggedly to revitalize the neglected neighborhood. When asked what brought them to Ramsey Hill, the Berglunds gave vague half-answers about the real estate market and wanting to be involved in something from the ground floor. They bought a cheap, shambling Victorian house and renovated it with stoic resolve. Together, they slowly won out over every obstacle they faced, from vandalism to unruly neighbors to general disrepair. Patty, a former athlete, always liked a challenge. She wheeled her infant son’s stroller through the gritty neighborhood, weaving deftly between cracks in the sidewalk, never breaking her strong, assured pace. She marched through a regiment of cooking, cleaning, repairing, and caring for the baby with an endurance forged in years of grueling, all-day swam practices. Even her indulgences—public radio and zinfandel—were stringently measured, slotted into the schedule with militant rigidity. Walter and Patty gave every indication that they were here in Ramsey Hill to stay, and nobody thought otherwise. But as the Berglunds built up their house and the surrounding area, they were really building less of a home and more of a ladder.",

        "MFA": "In St. Paul — or, at the very least, in the Ramsey Hill neighborhood — Walter and Patty Berglund were remembered as decent folks, despite the fact that they’d moved to Washington, D.C. two years ago. The Walter Berglund of the New York Times article, the “arrogant” and “ethically compromised” Walter, sounded like a different entity entirely, an evil twin or the result of a personality-altering traumatic brain injury. When he lived in Ramsey Hill, Walter would commute to work on his bike because it reduced carbon emissions, never mind the below-zero winters or the bluffs after Summit Avenue. During city council meetings, he gave passionate speeches about sorting plastics from paper. The Walter of Ramsey Hill believed in a better America, a green America, wild in its terrain, a patchwork of sustainable farms. Now the news, or at least the decent people at The New York Times and The Associated Press and The Washington Post, too, accused him of taking bribes from the coal industry. Walter and Petty first moved to Ramsey Hill back when it was still a neglected neighborhood; they thought of themselves as pioneers, do-gooders who could be the first to clean it up. With the little money they had, they’d bought a run-down Victorian house, and through the following years, they poured everything into that house’s restoration, fighting off plumbing failures, electrical outages, a neighbor with a penchant for yelling at his wife on the street, rotted wood, basement floods, and teen vandals — to address the latter, Patty had used a bat and a few stern, almost maternal, words. Patty, a former cheerleader for UMN, never fit into the neighborhood, visually speaking, though it hardly seemed to bother her. In the mornings, she jogged with her stroller, her blonde ponytail swinging behind her as she swerved to avoid the sidewalk feces, her face unflinching as the occasional truck driver whistled at her. In the afternoons, she painted the sidings of the house or installed kitchen tile between diaper changes and nursing sessions. In the evenings, she sat on the couch after preparing dinner, sipping a glass of zinfandel and listening to NPR, a radio station that would, in the unforeseeable future, refer to her as “the wife of disgraced politician, Walter Berglund.”",

        "MFA": "The people of St. Paul did not know what to make of the article; no, they could not even begin to wrap their heads around it. The New York Times, unforgiving and direct as they were, used such terms as \"arrogant,\" \"ethically compromised,\" and \"Machiavellian\" to describe Walter. These descriptions did not resonate with the mild folks of St. Paul, and, with Walter and Patty so far away in that vague place called DC, they found themselves remarkably able to preserve the veneer of what they believed Walter, and Patty for that matter, to be. The local women remembered handsome Walter, gold-skinned and smiling, commuting to work by bike, that sheen of sweat making a mustache of diamonds over his handsomely curved upper lip. The men remembered Walter rolling out the evergreen-colored recycling bin on those Wednesday mornings, the way it teetered with the weight of everything he had so meticulously and carefully separated from the regular trash.It just wouldn't do; no, it didn't compute—this image of Walter snuggled up in bed with the coal industry. That couple had poured life into Ramsey Hill, buying that decrepit and dirt-cheap Victorian house with the Napoleonic turrets and the cream wraparound porch. If they squinted, they could all picture Patty outside, painting over the word \"Fuck\" that a hooligan had sprayed onto the house's flank one night: she with her unflinching athleticism, the kind acquired in college sports, pushing a stroller with that well-weathered batting arm, a bag of apples in the other. If she was not standing on a ladder, scraping out the gutters like a man, she was drinking zinfandel at that gorgeous kitchen island she'd done herself, the public radio on, too loudly for most of the other women's tastes. It was the \"house on the hill\"—that was what everybody called it—and the Berglund children were disheveled and beautiful. The couple would throw dinner parties and put signs up in their yards about the ocean and sometimes fight so loudly that the people down the hill had to shut their windows to protect them, in their kind Midwestern way, from the shame of having been heard.",

We were meant to be discussing a literary magazine he was thinking of starting up: unfortunately I had to leave before we arrived at that subject.

        "MFA": "Before I left the country, a billionaire invited me to lunch at a London club. I’m working on a software for HR operations, he said. He wore an outfit that defied the club’s dress code: a dark T-shirt and darker jeans. It uses a predictive algorithm, he said, that scrapes employee backgrounds, e-mails, and market trends to identify which ones are likeliest to betray their companies. But I’ve been getting carried away. I’m starting a literary magazine; let’s discuss it. Unfortunately, by the time the literary subject came up, I’d already finished my entree and needed to leave for the airport. He insisted on paying for my taxi, which I accepted. I was late for my flight and carried a heavy suitcase. The billionaire had spent most of our lunch sharing his life story, which began with him as a humble public-school student and ended with him becoming the wealthy man leaning back in the chair across from me. I figured he wanted to use the literary magazine as a launchpad to becoming a writer himself. It wouldn’t be a ridiculous notion—he bought his way into a number of things. He told me he’d built a floating wind farm, located offshore from the township he was designing to house its workers. He also said he had a scheme to eliminate lawyers from people’s everyday lives and personal problems. For fun, he played drums in a psychedelic rock band, though he wasn’t writing any original songs. He was expecting his eleventh child, a surprise pregnancy; he and his wife had recently adopted quadruplets from Guatemala. Throughout the lunch, I found it difficult to respond thoughtfully, or even adequately, to the billionaire’s many ventures and projects. The waitresses kept bringing in appetizers on porcelain plates—foie gras, baked brie, oysters—and drinks in crystal glasses—mimosas, champagne. The billionaire jumped from topic to topic, and when his voice rose an octave as he described eliminating inefficiencies, he reminded me of a child barreling through the halls of an opulent mansion. At the end of lunch, he put me in the taxi and said, Enjoy yourself in Athens. I didn’t remember telling him where I was going?",

        "MFA": "The billionaire had invited me to lunch with him at a London club. When I arrived, I was surprised by how casually he dressed, in jeans and a white button-down. He was generous: on account of my enormous suitcase, he offered to call me a taxi to the airport when it was time to leave. He told me he was working on a software project that could predict an employee's capacity to betray their company. I didn't know why we were talking about this—we were meeting under the pretense of discussing a literary magazine that the billionaire was interested in starting—but I sat there and did my best to listen. He wanted to tell me many things, his whole life story. He had grown up poor, he said, but that hadn't lasted long, and now he had a floating windfarm that doubled as worker housing, and an idea for a scheme to keep lawyers out of people's personal business. He told me about the rock band he played drums in, and that he was expecting his eleventh child soon. This was in addition to the four Guatemalan quadruplets he had already adopted. It felt like too many children to me. I wondered if perhaps he thought that by creating this magazine, he might also fashion himself as a writer capable of being published in it. The idea seemed a stretch to me, but perhaps the billionaire was used to spanning such extreme logical leaps. The leap from man to billionaire was certainly larger than billionaire to writer. I was struggling to follow my own line of thinking. The waitress kept appearing, bringing brightly colored drinks and dishes that alternated between tasting too rich and too pungent. It had the opposite effect on the billionaire. Amidst the bright colors and flavors, the billionaire's face shone like a young boy who had been suddenly surrounded by mountains of his favorite sweets. When the food and drink had finally been swept away and the bill paid, he put me and my heavy suitcase in the taxi. Enjoy yourself in Athens, he said, which was a surprise. I hadn't recalled ever mentioning my destination.",

        "MFA": "I am Nanapush, and my people, the Anishinabe, have borne floods of suffering that rose like tidal waves over the generations. We’ve learned to endure the violent waters. First, there was the terrible spotted sickness that came from the south, killing us by the dozens and scarring the faces of the living. There was the long migration west, where we were marched to the Dakotas with an army at our backs, and the treaty we signed at gunpoint. Then came another exile—a slow dismemberment of the land that remained, bled dry by a series of laws and documents. My people were left alone for some time after that. But in 1914, consumption began to prowl the perimeter of the reservation. Its footfall was silent, though its presence was anything but invisible. When consumption snapped its jaws, it unraveled the community death by death, trapping families like the Pillagers inside, left to huddle in their close quarters and wait out the disease. I see now that the disease was waiting them out instead. The Pillagers succumbed to the sickness one by one—all of them but me. Although I am only fifty, I have risen through the ranks by default. I am considered an elder now. In truth, I am merely a survivor. It is under my watch that our traditional way of life has finally been extinguished. It was I who led the final buffalo hunt, trapped the last beaver with a mature pelt, and felled the last of the old birch trees. Loss is my constant companion. It visits me as it visited my ancestors, but I have found a small mercy within its grasp. I have preserved the last of the Pillager family, refusing the men from the government who come with more papers to sign, seeking more ways to strip the Anishinabe of their land and identity. As long as my name is Nanapush, I will not forfeit that final power.",

These were made to be broken and to break us. After came more displacements, the government making exiles of us again. So many documents and so much displacement. I lie on my back and these papers press hard on my chest when I think of them. In 1914 it was consumption, creeping slowly through the reservation like woodsmoke. Taking us one by one, and unraveling us, and my family could not escape it either. The Pillagers were unraveled by this new sickness and so was our community, huddled so close together as we were. Unable to escape each other, shoulder, pressed to shoulder, and unable to escape the sickness. I was the only one of us who lived. Nanapush, the sole survivor. For this suffering I am already an elder, but I am only fifty years old. And for this terrible privilege I have been witness to the end of the traditions. I have led the last buffalo hunt, saw the last bear killed. Trapped the last beaver with a mature pelt, and felled the last old birch. Sometimes we understood we were doing these things for the final time. Other times, we didn't realize until after. The loss hurts in my teeth. It lives in my early wrinkles and sore body. But I have saved the Pillager family. When the government comes with more papers, more opportunities to strip us of our land and our identity, I have resisted. I did not sign. I will not sign—we will not be exiles again. Too much has already been taken. The Anishinabe persist, and I will continue to resist for the Pillagers who are lost, and for those of us who carry on.",

The wine loosens her tongue and she cannot help it when she says, \"America is obsessed with race. I never realized how much until I moved here and now I can't get away from it.\" She speaks quickly, the words coming easily to her despite the many eyes now firmly fixed on her. With her captive audience, she could almost be a college professor, the kind that reminds her of cult leaders. The watching usually makes her skin crawl, but now it feels like the eyes are attached to ears that are earnestly listening. She tells them that every time she goes outside, she is acutely aware of her blackness in a way she has never experienced before. \"Because I'm so aware,\" she says, \"I'm extra-aware when I'm with a boyfriend. And it's not just me, it's everyone in an interracial relationship! You don't want your boyfriend accusing you of being too sensitive, you know? Men always call women crybabies, so you don't want him thinking you're any more emotional than he already believes. Confirmation bias! So you pretend it doesn't bother you, even though it really does. And you can't complain to anyone else about your white boyfriend, either, because there's always some old crone muttering about how, well,\" she pitches her voice for a biting mimicry. \"Interracial relationships used to be illegal, which is so infantilizing to point out! Just because things used to be worse, doesn't mean I can't be frustrated by them still being bad!\" she says, and she looks at her nice, liberal audience, and how they've all put down their forks as if eating would mean they aren't listening. They're leaning forward, watching her like a specimen under a microscope. Her hosts are chuckling to each other, but nodding along. Next to them, the poet, who has been a far quieter guest than Ifemelu, tugs at the Frenchwoman's sleeve to nervously compliment one of the side dishes. She absently thanks him and gestures for Ifemelu to keep going. Blaine's face is shuttered, and Ifemelu takes another sip of wine. Distantly, she thinks she might regret this tomorrow. She opens her mouth, though, and says, \"It was like that with my ex-boyfriend, Curt.\" Blaine's lip twitches. Ifemelu says, \"He just couldn't understand.\"",

In Nigeria, I hardly thought of my race. But here, I'm constantly reminded of it, and not just by racists and rednecks like you might think, but by white liberals, academics, even other Black people, to tell you the truth. And to make matters worse, I can't say anything about it, or I'll be seen as making a fuss since we've apparently come so far. They'll point out that I have a white boyfriend and no one gives me any trouble for it, when interracial marriage used to be illegal. They call that progress when that's the bare minimum. Frankly, it's patronizing.\" Ifemelu looked pointedly at the poet, who had kept her head down and was picking at her salad. The poet avoided her eye contact and instead turned to the hostess, as if she sensed an opportunity to change the subject. \"This salad is so delicious,\" she said, holding up a forkful of greens. The hostess thanked her, but she was still watching Ifemelu with anticipation and maybe some detached amusement, since this wasn't her home country, and Ifemelu had said nothing about France. Her American husband, meanwhile, seemed excited to have his cadre of polite and well-educated liberals challenged by this unfamiliar woman, his friend's new girlfriend. Ifemelu reached for the wine glass again and looked up at Blaine to see if she'd gone too far, but his gaze was inscrutable, though fixed on her. Well, if what he loved about me is my mind, he can't be mad if I speak it, she thought. And if she said something too scandalous, she could always write them an apology note later. And before she could stop herself, she was telling them all the deeply personal stuff about her struggles while dating Curt.",

By every fact of history, it can’t exist. This place must be a delusion, too. Yet here we are.And America, too, is a delusion, the grandest one of all. The white race believes—believes with all its heart—that it is their right to take the land. To kill Indians. Make war. Enslave their brothers. This nation shouldn’t exist, if there is any justice in the world, for its foundations are murder, theft, and cruelty. Yet here we are.“I’m supposed to answer Mingo’s call for gradual progress, for closing our doors to those in need. I’m supposed to answer those who think this place is too close to the grievous influence of slavery, and that we should move west. I don’t have an answer for you. I don’t know what we should do. The word we. In some ways, the only thing we have in common is the color of our skin. Our ancestors came from all over the African continent. It’s quite large. Brother Valentine has the maps of the world in his splendid library, you can look for yourself. They had different ways of subsistence, different customs, spoke a hundred different languages. And that great mixture was brought to America in the holds of slave ships. To the north, the south. Their sons and daughters picked tobacco, cultivated cotton, worked on the largest estates and smallest farms. We are craftsmen and midwives and preachers and peddlers. Black hands built the White House, the seat of our nation’s government. The word we. We are not one people but many different people. How can one person speak for this great, beautiful race—which is not one race but many, with a million desires and hopes and wishes for ourselves and our children?",
        "MFA": "Valentine Farm is a delusion. It's no more real than one of those heat shimmers that disappear as you step closer. How could Black people even have a haven like that? The transatlantic ships, the endless days of toiling, the many nights of dying—they already preclude the possibility of a sanctuary. It's too late. It's impossible. The scars can't heal—they're white, carved on our cheeks. And America itself is the grandest delusion, a series of territories thrown together on the basis of mass murder, theft, and cruelty. The white race believes it has the right to do all this—the right to take land, start wars, enslave us. The very existence of America defies the notion of justice. Now, I suppose there are two possibilities left. We can pursue gradual progress: reform, speech-making—and close our doors to those in need. Or we can move west, to someplace far from the violent grasp of slavery, to somewhere fresher and less polluted. I don't have an answer. I can't even say who \"we\" are. Aren't \"we\" many peoples, descended from all over the vast continent of Africa? It may not be the case anymore, but generations ago, \"we\" spoke different languages. \"We\" worshiped different gods. \"We\" had different kings, farmed different vegetables, sang different songs with different instruments. There is only one thing that unites us: slavery. Here, now, in this foreign land, we are craftsmen, midwives, laborers. We are everything to this violent country. It was Black people who quarried the stone of the White House, who assembled its roof and walls. And we are not a monolith. Each of us holds a singular amount of courage, of ambition, of love. Each of us has suffered in unique ways. Each of us sees something different when we look into the eyes of our children. There is no single voice that can speak for us. Not even mine.",
