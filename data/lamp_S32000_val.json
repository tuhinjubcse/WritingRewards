Agreed?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to sleep with him,\u201d Nana said. She closed the cell phone and held it to her throat, shut her eyes, and felt Pete all around her. Now she debated phoning Helen. One wanted to tell, she realized. After the initial crucial privacy, one wished to speak aloud what had transpired. As an excuse, as an opening gambit, she could ask Helen to keep an eye on her husband\u2019s drinking at the Merrills\u2019; also, she could thank Helen for the flowers, which had arrived that afternoon, lurid non-native blossoms that vaguely alarmed Lil. Nana could ask what Helen would be wearing tonight, what had happened at Libby\u2019s, two evenings before.

Doesn\u2019t it?\u201d The girl paused. Nana had pushed herself back to the window that led onto the roof, was beginning to climb inside.

As the call ended, her thoughts drifted to Helen, contemplating whether to reach out about her husband's drinking problem or simply express gratitude for the flowers she'd recently sent. The decision to dial Helen's number led to an unexpected conversation with Rebecca, whose cryptic revelation that Helen was already at Nana's place sent a chill down her spine.

    "paragraph1": "She trudged through the dense forest, her muscles aching from the weight of Max secured to her back in a makeshift swaddle fashioned from old blankets and rope, while Quinn, the worn fabric doll, rested safely in the backpack strapped to her chest. The forest canopy filtered the sunlight, creating a dappled pattern on the leaf-strewn ground as Max's small hands occasionally reached out to grasp at low-hanging branches and colorful leaves, his delighted giggles breaking the otherwise eerie silence. As they ventured deeper into the wilderness, she remained vigilant, her eyes scanning the undergrowth for any signs of movement, knowing that various creatures called these woods home. Max would sometimes engage in animated conversations with Quinn, pulling the doll from the backpack to show it interesting findings like peculiar stones or vibrant mushrooms, while she carefully rationed their dwindling supplies, making mental notes of edible plants and water sources they encountered. The forest gradually began to thin, the lush vegetation giving way to scraggly bushes and eventually bare earth, until they found themselves at the edge of a vast, sandy expanse that stretched endlessly before them. The transition was jarring, like stepping from one world into another, and she hesitated before pressing forward into this barren landscape where the wind whispered strange songs and the sand shifted beneath their feet in unpredictable patterns. As darkness descended, the environment took on an increasingly surreal quality, with shadows bending in impossible ways and the horizon seeming to pulse and breathe like a living entity. Her exhaustion mounted as she struggled to maintain her bearings in this disorienting terrain, the weight of Max and their supplies becoming nearly unbearable. In a moment of confusion, amid swirling sand and deceiving darkness, she realized with horror that she could no longer feel Max's presence against her back. Panic seized her heart as she spun around, calling out his name into the void, until her eyes finally found him sitting perfectly still in the sand, his small figure illuminated by a strange, ambient light. Relief flooded through her as she rushed to gather him in her arms, but as they emerged from the darkness into a patch of clearer visibility, her hand instinctively reached for the front pocket of her backpack, finding it empty. Quinn, Max's constant companion and sole source of comfort in this harsh world, was gone, lost somewhere in the vast expanse of sand and shadow they had traversed. The realization hit her like a physical blow, and she collapsed to her knees, hot tears streaming down her face as Max looked on in confusion. The doll had been more than just a plaything; it had been a symbol of normalcy, a small piece of childhood preserved in a world that seemed determined to strip away all innocence and joy. She held Max close as she wept, knowing that they would have to press on without Quinn, another small loss in a journey marked by countless sacrifices, yet this one felt particularly cruel. The wind continued to blow across the desolate landscape, carrying with it the ghost of children's laughter and the memory of simpler times, as she gathered her strength to stand once more, adjusting Max's weight on her back and facing the uncertain path ahead with renewed determination, though her heart ached for the small comfort they had lost in the unforgiving darkness.",
    "paragraph2": "V. She fixed him to her back in a swaddle of cut bedsheets and wore the backpack on her front. Quinn she stuffed down beside him. The straps chafed, and Max squirmed and kicked, sometimes he cried, but mostly, as they travelled, he spoke softly to the doll. In the afternoon, they passed the lake. A victory. Of course, there was only more forest, all the same. She built a fire beneath an overhanging rock; she ate jerky and apologized to Max for not feeding him. He pouted but then wandered off, picking up sticks and digging with them in the earth. The sun set. They sang to Quinn: I\u2019ll see you in the mo-or-ning. In the night, she woke and felt Max breathing against her. They followed the sun, so she called it west. Sometimes the hills they climbed would level and drop limply back down; other times, they\u2019d break through the tree line to bare rocky stretches, where eagles skimmed overhead. They travelled along a mountain ridge, two beautiful days, but had to double back when they came to a high chasm: no way down. That afternoon, they saw black bears, three of them, nosing along the mountainside. She shifted Max so he could see and said, \u201cBears.\u201d She stewed and ate nettles; she kicked mushrooms from tree trunks and roasted them. When Max put both hands into the fire, she panicked and started to shout, then stopped and let him. The trees thinned. No more big pines, only firs, growing shorter and sparser, until\u2014it happened so gradually she barely noticed\u2014they were out of the forest. The soil turned sandy and pale. Before them was nothing. Nothing whatsoever. Now and then, she\u2019d look back: the forest\u2019s edge, like a wall, and the mountains looming over it, clouds and sky above the peaks, all together like something in a fishbowl. She walked until it was only a green-blue smear, and then nothing. And then they were nowhere. On her back, Max was quiet and still. The sand was soft and felt nice on her feet. It faded to a dirty white, like smudged paper, and so did the horizon. When the lack of perspective made her dizzy, she walked with her eyes shut. They had no fires. She ran out of water. Sometimes Max whispered things in her ear. Then the last trace of gray was gone from the sand. It was fine and synthetic-feeling; when displaced, it whirled in the air with unnatural lightness. The sky darkened, and the air grew thinner; it tasted like plastic. Then the only light was behind her, as if she were walking into a cave. And soon they were in total darkness. O.K., she thought. What now. She sat down, slipped the backpack\u2019s straps over her arms, and found the lighter. Briefly, it lit the space around them. She pulled Max from her back, curled up with him, and fell asleep. When she woke, he was gone. She felt for the lighter and couldn\u2019t find it; the darkness jumped before her eyes. But then she calmed herself: he couldn\u2019t have gone far. She angled her head to listen, in one direction, then another, and on hands and knees she found the place where the sand went smooth again. In rigid, deliberate movements she crawled out, feeling with her fingers, counting each motion away from the backpack, and then returning. Wider each time, a spiral. Finally she felt a divot in the sand ahead of her, and then another. She followed the indentations out, slow and careful, the blood loud in her ears. Her fingertips found Max\u2019s cloth diaper, and then his back, his shoulders, the nape of his neck; she went into a crouch and drew her arms around him. Only later did it terrify her: he\u2019d been sitting perfectly still, staring into the dark. Back out in the light, it was the first thing she noticed: \u201cMax. Where is Quinn?\u201d She dug through the pack. \u201cQuinn,\u201d he said. She looked toward the dark, then at him, and fell into wild sobs.",

Toby, all of nine years old and already too clever for his own good, rolled his eyes while seven-year-old Mia clutched her tablet expectantly. \"But Uncle Mike won't mind,\" they chorused, and I couldn't help but smile at their innocent assumption that their beloved uncle's legendary good nature somehow exempted them from basic courtesy. Toby, recently exposed to classic films, threw me a curve ball by quoting \"Trading Places\" with surprising timing, making me wonder if I was fighting a losing battle. The mention of Michael made me pause and reflect on our friendship, a relationship that had weathered decades of changes. Here was a man who had built his fortune from scratch, amassing wealth that would make most people's heads spin, yet he remained remarkably unchanged by it all. It was this quality that earned him not just respect but genuine admiration from everyone who knew him.

Toby, all of nine years old and already too clever for his own good, rolled his eyes while seven-year-old Mia clutched her tablet expectantly. \"But Uncle Mike won't mind,\" they chorused, and I couldn't help but smile at their innocent assumption that their beloved uncle's legendary good nature somehow exempted them from basic courtesy. Toby, recently exposed to classic films, threw me a curve ball by quoting \"Trading Places\" with surprising timing, making me wonder if I was fighting a losing battle. The mention of Michael made me pause and reflect on our friendship, a relationship that had weathered decades of changes. Here was a man who had built his fortune from scratch, amassing wealth that would make most people's heads spin, yet he remained remarkably unchanged by it all. It was this quality that earned him not just respect but genuine admiration from everyone who knew him.

Remember how at the end of Season 1, the Stranger had to protect his harfoot friends from three mystics dressed in white who referred to him as \u201cthe Dark Lord?\u201d This was a clever bit of misdirection from the \u201cRings of Power\u201d writers, meant to keep the viewers from catching on too quickly that Halbrand was secretly Sauron. But the incident also helped the Stranger remember that he is actually of the Istari, an ancient order of wizards who in various forms have often intervened in the affairs of Middle-earth. In this season\u2019s second episode, those mystics return to their home base to report to the Dark Wizard (Ciaran Hinds) on their encounter with the Stranger. The sequence is one of the show\u2019s most visually inventive to date, involving a woman bleeding onto the floor while surrounded by hundreds of butterflies \u2014 the form the mystics dissipated into after the Stranger violently attacked them \u2014 which flutter about and then reconstitute into a different woman. It\u2019s a moment way more elaborate than it needs to be (in a good way), given that this whole scene\u2019s primary purpose is to introduce the Dark Wizard\u2019s masked mortal soldiers, who announce their intention either to capture the Istari or to \u201cslaughter the halflings he calls friends.\u201d",
    "paragraph2": "The return of the three mystics to their stronghold marks a pivotal moment in \"Rings of Power\" Episode 2, as they bring dire news to the Dark Wizard, portrayed by Ciaran Hinds, about their confrontation with the Stranger.

Remember how at the end of Season 1, the Stranger had to protect his harfoot friends from three mystics dressed in white who referred to him as \u201cthe Dark Lord?\u201d This was a clever bit of misdirection from the \u201cRings of Power\u201d writers, meant to keep the viewers from catching on too quickly that Halbrand was secretly Sauron. But the incident also helped the Stranger remember that he is actually of the Istari, an ancient order of wizards who in various forms have often intervened in the affairs of Middle-earth. In this season\u2019s second episode, those mystics return to their home base to report to the Dark Wizard (Ciaran Hinds) on their encounter with the Stranger. The sequence is one of the show\u2019s most visually inventive to date, involving a woman bleeding onto the floor while surrounded by hundreds of butterflies \u2014 the form the mystics dissipated into after the Stranger violently attacked them \u2014 which flutter about and then reconstitute into a different woman. It\u2019s a moment way more elaborate than it needs to be (in a good way), given that this whole scene\u2019s primary purpose is to introduce the Dark Wizard\u2019s masked mortal soldiers, who announce their intention either to capture the Istari or to \u201cslaughter the halflings he calls friends.\u201d\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe return of the three mystics to their stronghold marks a pivotal moment in \"Rings of Power\" Episode 2, as they bring dire news to the Dark Wizard, portrayed by Ciaran Hinds, about their confrontation with the Stranger. Having previously faced defeat when the Stranger, now known to be one of the ancient Istari wizards, defended his harfoot companions, the mystics' return is portrayed through a visually striking sequence.

    "paragraph1": "After Christmas, I looked for a job. The ads in the newspaper were for low-paying jobs, like file clerk or telephone solicitor or receptionist. My mother drove me to interviews for maybe a week before I found a secretarial position that didn\u2019t require experience, working for a lawyer in Westland named Ned Johnson. The office was in a small house, brick, with stiff fir trees on either side of the door and a flower box under the window. My mother waited in the car while I went to the door. Ned Johnson was there by himself. Given that he would wander my dream-mind for decades, I don\u2019t know why my memory of our first meeting is so vague, obscured by disconnected feelings that move like clouds or greasy smoke across the receding moment. He was a short, thick-bodied man with deep, shining, active eyes. I was startled by him without knowing why. During the interview, I said weird things I wouldn\u2019t normally say. He told me that the job was dull, and I said, \u201cI like dull work.\u201d He stared as if he were insulted, and I thought the interview was over\u2014but instead he said something weird. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s something off about you. You\u2019re closed and tight, like a wall.\u201d And I just said, \u201cI know.\u201d When my mother asked how the interview went, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think he liked me.\u201d But the next day a girl called and told me he wanted to hire me. She said I could start tomorrow if it was convenient. My parents were really happy. I remember my father smiling, holding a can of beer and some peanuts; there was something special for dessert. The people who came into the office were odds and ends in human form: a man with a scar on his face who was suing his neighbors because their dog barked \u201call goddam day,\u201d a middle-aged Black woman in mod teen clothes, an old Russian lady in a purple coat. The furniture, too, was comically mismatched, and there was too much of it for the low-ceilinged rectangular room: two cheap swollen couches faced each other before my grossly big oak desk, which itself pointlessly faced two haughty high-backed armchairs, positioned as if for an important meeting that never took place. But I liked the strange furniture. It made the lawyer seem more human because it offset his extreme consistency, his choppy economical movements, his always shining eyes. His style of training was loud and cheerful, full of stressful encouragement. When I did something right, he would clap his hands and say, \u201cShe\u2019s coming along!\u201d If I made a mistake, he would say, \u201cSlowly, slowly!\u201d or \u201cJust do the best you can!\u201d It was the same voice he used to greet a client he liked, the old lady from Russia who wore the purple coat with a thick sash knotted around her crumpled waist. She was the only foreigner I had ever met and she was the only person the lawyer came out of his office to meet, instead of just buzzing me to send her in. When she was next on the list, he would open his door and say, \u201cThere\u2019s my girlfriend!,\u201d and she would rise and wobble toward him with fierce, caneless dignity. His attention to her made me trust him. Because there were clients that he did not like at all and he didn\u2019t bother to hide it from me, saying things like \u201cHe is completely crazy\u201d or \u201cI feel sorry for her husband.\u201d He was sincere in his likes and dislikes. When Donna asked me how the job was, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.\u201d But I liked it more than that because it was so much better than school. At school, I\u2019d had no friends, except for a girl named Sandy, and the only thing we had in common was that we both liked animals. I almost never talked, because I didn\u2019t know how; I couldn\u2019t understand the way other kids talked to one another. I felt afraid all the time.

My skill in English was so useless that I despised it; even my parents didn\u2019t care that much about it. It wasn\u2019t like that in the lawyer\u2019s office.

When he got home he would make Robert a new cardboard keyboard and beg him to practice. He might even order him to practice.

Good God, but life could be less than easy, not that he was unaware that it could certainly be a lot worse, but to go about in such a state, pulse high, face red, worried sick that someone would notice how nervous one was, was certainly less than ideal, and he felt sure that his body was secreting all kinds of harmful chemicals and that the more he worried about the harmful chemicals the faster they were pouring out of wherever it was they came from.",

Good God, but life could be less than easy, not that he was unaware that it could certainly be a lot worse, but to go about in such a state, pulse high, face red, worried sick that someone would notice how nervous one was, was certainly less than ideal, and he felt sure that his body was secreting all kinds of harmful chemicals and that the more he worried about the harmful chemicals the faster they were pouring out of wherever it was they came from.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs Morse stood there, his mind began to wander to the impending piano recital that his son Robert was scheduled to perform in, and his anxiety level skyrocketed.

Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., who oversees the Purdue cases, said the lawsuits against Purdue and the Sacklers would continue to be paused during the mediation period. The intent of the recent spate of filings is to paint a vivid picture of the legal onslaught that the Sacklers would be likely to face should the short window of time for allotted mediation slam shut without a deal. A filing this week from a government-appointed committee representing a broad group of creditors argues that the Sacklers illegally siphoned $11.5 billion from Purdue in less than a decade to wall off the money from potential litigation. That kind of claim, known as fraudulent conveyance, is a standard move in bankruptcy court in which creditors can seek to reclaim money they believe has been illegally squirreled away and should be included in distributions to them. The creditors\u2019 filing included both a request to bring the case and a 200-page draft of their prospective complaint, in which they requested a jury trial. Although Purdue is not directly pursuing this claim against its owners, the company said on Tuesday that it supported the action. \u201cIf a consensual resolution is not reached through mediation, however, litigation will be necessary, and we believe the creditors\u2019 committee is the party best situated to prosecute these claims,\u201d Purdue said in a statement.",

On Tuesday, Judge Sean H. Lane of the U. S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y., who oversees the Purdue cases, said the lawsuits against Purdue and the Sacklers would continue to be paused during the mediation period. The intent of the recent spate of filings is to paint a vivid picture of the legal onslaught that the Sacklers would be likely to face should the short window of time for allotted mediation slam shut without a deal. A filing this week from a government-appointed committee representing a broad group of creditors argues that the Sacklers illegally siphoned $11.5 billion from Purdue in less than a decade to wall off the money from potential litigation. That kind of claim, known as fraudulent conveyance, is a standard move in bankruptcy court in which creditors can seek to reclaim money they believe has been illegally squirreled away and should be included in distributions to them. The creditors\u2019 filing included both a request to bring the case and a 200-page draft of their prospective complaint, in which they requested a jury trial. Although Purdue is not directly pursuing this claim against its owners, the company said on Tuesday that it supported the action. \u201cIf a consensual resolution is not reached through mediation, however, litigation will be necessary, and we believe the creditors\u2019 committee is the party best situated to prosecute these claims,\u201d Purdue said in a statement.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn the ongoing legal saga surrounding Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, Judge Sean H.

White wisps of steam rose from the serving plates. A glass vase bearing a dozen lilies occupied the center of the table. Four places were set with napkins and cutlery, untouched, by the look of it. It seemed as though people had been sitting down to eat their breakfast a few minutes earlier, when some sudden and unforeseen event sent them all running off. What had happened? Where had they gone? Or where had they been taken? Would they return to eat their breakfast? But Samsa had no time to ponder such questions. Falling into the nearest chair, he grabbed whatever food he could reach with his bare hands and stuffed it into his mouth, quite ignoring the knives, spoons, forks, and napkins. He tore bread into pieces and downed it without jam or butter, gobbled fat boiled sausages whole, devoured hard-boiled eggs with such speed that he almost forgot to peel them, scooped up handfuls of still warm mashed potatoes, and plucked pickles with his fingers. He chewed it all together, and washed the remnants down with water from a jug. Taste was of no consequence. Bland or delicious, spicy or sour\u2014it was all the same to him. All that mattered was filling that empty cavern inside him. He ate with total concentration, as if racing against time. He was so fixated on eating that once, as he was licking his fingers, he sank his teeth into them by mistake. Scraps of food flew everywhere, and when a platter fell to the floor and smashed he paid no attention whatsoever. By the time Samsa had eaten his fill and sat back to catch his breath, almost nothing was left, and the dining table was an awful sight.

Wine glasses teetered and fell, their contents creating dark pools that spread across the white linen like spilled blood.

She playfully reached out and tickled me, sending me into a fit of laughter, my breath catching in my throat as I tried to squirm away. The moment was a much-needed respite from the chaos that had been my day so far. I had missed my morning classes, and to make matters worse, I was running late for my shift at the cafeteria. As I rushed to get ready, I couldn't shake off the feeling of inadequacy that had been plaguing me lately. I thought back to the advice Beverly and Kay had given me, about how I needed to be more confident, more outgoing, if I wanted to catch the eye of a guy. But every time I tried, I seemed to get it wrong, and I couldn't help but feel like I was stuck in some kind of rut. After a hectic shift at the cafeteria, I decided to head to the library to work on an essay that was due soon. As I walked through the tunnel that connected the buildings, I was bombarded by advertisements plastered on the walls - \"Get fit with our gym membership\", \"Eat healthy with our meal plans\" - the usual college fare. But one notice caught my eye, a recital announcement that brought back memories of a poem by Housman we had studied in class. The lines \"That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain, the happy highways where I went and cannot come again\" echoed in my mind, and I felt a pang of shame wash over me.

She playfully reached out and tickled me, sending me into a fit of laughter, my breath catching in my throat as I tried to squirm away. The moment was a much-needed respite from the chaos that had been my day so far. I had missed my morning classes, and to make matters worse, I was running late for my shift at the cafeteria. As I rushed to get ready, I couldn't shake off the feeling of inadequacy that had been plaguing me lately. I thought back to the advice Beverly and Kay had given me, about how I needed to be more confident, more outgoing, if I wanted to catch the eye of a guy. But every time I tried, I seemed to get it wrong, and I couldn't help but feel like I was stuck in some kind of rut. After a hectic shift at the cafeteria, I decided to head to the library to work on an essay that was due soon. As I walked through the tunnel that connected the buildings, I was bombarded by advertisements plastered on the walls - \"Get fit with our gym membership\", \"Eat healthy with our meal plans\" - the usual college fare. But one notice caught my eye, a recital announcement that brought back memories of a poem by Housman we had studied in class. The lines \"That is the land of lost content, I see it shining plain, the happy highways where I went and cannot come again\" echoed in my mind, and I felt a pang of shame wash over me. It was a memory I had tried to bury, but it still lingered, a reminder of a past experience that I would rather forget. I pushed the thoughts aside and focused on my essay, but the words of the poem lingered, a haunting reminder of the fragility of life and the choices we make.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry I yelled at you.

But at last she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014she fell asleep herself. And when she awoke in the morning Daniel was gone. After a while, when he didn\u2019t come back, she put on her underclothes and her dress, and set off around the house in search of him. Downstairs, she smelled Paddy\u2019s sweat and saw the tousled mess of his hair, poking from the top of a sleeping bag on the sofa in the lounge. Nigel was making a racket outside with the sliding door of the garage, in search of the net for the swimming pool. Jane climbed upstairs again. Nigel\u2019s parents\u2019 bedroom was at the front of the house, opening off the landing ahead of her; the door was ajar, and Jane stepped soundlessly inside. It was a beautiful room, like nothing she\u2019d ever seen before, with a pale wood floor and plain white walls, creamy sheepskin rugs. Fresh sunlight, pouring through windows all along its length, was reflected in the mirrored doors of the built-in wardrobes; the curtains, in some kind of rough white translucent linen, were cut too long for the windows, and the cloth fell in heaps on the floor. A huge bed seemed to be all white sheets and no blankets. (Jane had never seen a duvet before.) In the bed, with the duvet kicked to their feet, Daniel and Fiona lay naked and asleep, facing away from each other, their slim tanned legs tangled together. Jane, who had done the Greeks in history, thought that they looked like young warriors in a classical scene, fallen in the place where they had been wrestling. She withdrew from the room without waking them, as quietly as she had come in. Nigel, rather the worse for wear, in his pajama bottoms, was smoking and skimming the pool, dumping the rubbish in a soaking heap beside him. He watched when Jane came to stand at the pool\u2019s brink; she stared in with dry, hot eyes. \u201cSo now you know,\u201d he said. But she repudiated his offer of companionship in her unrequited love. Her experience was not like anyone else\u2019s. She asked only if he would drive her home, and he said he\u2019d get the car out as soon as he\u2019d finished with the pool. \u201cI\u2019d like to go now,\u201d she said crisply, sounding like her mother. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d On the way back, they hardly spoke, except when Nigel asked for directions as they drew near the house. Jane forgot, in her absorption, to notice the way they\u2019d come, so that she never afterward knew where she\u2019d been. And she never saw Nigel\u2019s house again, or any of the boys (Fiona once, perhaps, at a party). He dropped her off at the bottom of the drive. It was still quite early in the morning\u2014only nine o\u2019clock. Jane stared around her as if she\u2019d never seen the place before, as if it were more mysterious than anywhere she\u2019d been\u2014the scuffed dirt at the edge of the road, the old mossy gateposts, blackbirds flitting in the dead leaves at the bottom of the hedge, the hard lime-yellow fruits in the hedge apple tree, her own footprints from the day before intact in the dust, the Jokari paddle left where she had dropped it.",

The empty space beside her in bed triggered an immediate search through the house, her footsteps echoing against wooden floors and her heart drumming an increasingly anxious rhythm until she reached the fateful bedroom door. There, the scene that greeted her struck with the weight of ancient Greek tragedy: Daniel and Fiona's naked bodies intertwined in sleep, their peaceful expressions a cruel contrast to the turmoil erupting within her chest. The sight burned itself into her memory with the persistence of a branded mark, forcing her to withdraw with the quiet grace of someone who had witnessed something both sacred and profane. The hallway seemed longer on her retreat, each step carrying her further from a reality she had hoped to create and closer to one she never wanted to accept. Outside, the morning sun cast an almost mocking brightness over the scene, where Nigel methodically skimmed the pool's surface, creating ripples that mirrored the disturbances in Jane's emotional waters. His offered companionship, though genuine, bounced off the protective shell she had already begun to form around herself, and her request for a ride home emerged as much from a desire to flee as from practical necessity. The car journey unfolded in a cocoon of silence, with Jane so deeply entrenched in her internal landscape that the external world became a blur of meaningless shapes and colors, effectively erasing the route from her memory \u2013 a subconscious act of self-preservation ensuring she would never retrace these steps to Nigel's house or cross paths with the boys again.

The weight of her unrequited love hung heavy in the air of her home, transforming the space into a museum of what could have been, each room holding echoes of possibilities that would never materialize, while the physical distance she had put between herself and the morning's discovery seemed to only emphasize the emotional chasm that had opened within her. The sunlight streaming through her windows illuminated dust particles dancing in the air, their random movements somehow embodying the chaos she felt inside, while the familiar sounds of her neighborhood \u2013 children playing, cars passing, birds singing \u2013 created a surreal soundtrack to her altered state of consciousness, highlighting how the world continued its normal rhythm even as her personal universe had shifted on its axis.",

The weight of this relationship bore heavily on Jacob's conscience, rooted in the shared history of his grandfather Isaac and great-uncle Benny, Holocaust survivors whose means of survival remained shrouded in unspoken darkness, their separate paths leading to America and Israel respectively, where they built parallel lives that would forever be connected yet distinctly apart. The family tree branched through their sons, Shlomo and Irv, eventually reaching Jacob and Tamir, cousins who inherited not just blood ties but also the unspoken obligation to maintain a connection neither fully embraced nor completely rejected. Their family visits played out like carefully choreographed performances, each side acutely aware of their differences while maintaining a veneer of familial warmth, their interactions peppered with subtle judgments and cultural misunderstandings that neither party could fully bridge. The death of Isaac marked a turning point, bringing Tamir to American soil for the funeral, where the cousins found themselves sharing beers and unprecedented honesty about their grandfather's life - a life that Jacob now viewed through the dual lens of shame: shame for accepting the monotony that had characterized Isaac's existence, and shame for presuming to judge it. The conversation with Tamir that night exposed the superficiality of their relationship, leading Jacob to a painful recognition of his own role in maintaining this distance, despite his performative use of \"our\" when referring to his Israeli relatives. The realization that he had allowed this meaningful connection to wither into mere obligation weighed heavily on Jacob, who found himself caught between his instinct to maintain familial bonds and his discomfort with too close an association, a contradiction that seemed to mirror the complex dynamics between their respective nations and cultures. This internal struggle manifested in his daily life through small gestures and word choices, like his insistence on using \"our\" when referring to Tamir's family, a linguistic choice that seemed to compensate for the actual distance he helped maintain. The relationship between the cousins, much like the branching paths their grandfathers took after the war, represented both the endurance and fragility of family bonds across geographical, cultural, and ideological divides, with Jacob's regret serving as a poignant reminder of the opportunities lost in allowing these connections to fade into mere formality. Their shared heritage, marked by their grandfathers' survival and subsequent divergent paths, created an unspoken bond that neither cousin fully embraced nor could entirely ignore, leaving them in a perpetual state of connection and disconnection, much like their respective nations. The complexity of their relationship was further complicated by the unspoken expectations and obligations that came with their shared history, creating a dynamic where both felt compelled to maintain contact while simultaneously keeping each other at arm's length, their interactions marked by a peculiar mix of familiarity and distance that neither seemed able to bridge completely. This tension between obligation and genuine connection, between shared history and divergent presents, between the desire to maintain family ties and the comfort of distance, all came to a head during that post-funeral conversation, leaving Jacob with a profound sense of loss - not just for his grandfather, but for the deeper connection with Tamir that he had never fully pursued, a realization that came too late to easily remedy but not too late to acknowledge",

Sometimes there\u2019s a soccer game happening, or kids are goofing off. Earlier this season, a man reading a book in a dugout refused to leave, claiming he was not bothering anyone. But it was a potentially unsafe situation. \u201cThe cops got involved, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that,\u201d Ms. Karcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant for the girls to have to deal with that.\u201d\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn her second year overseeing the sports program, Ms. Page initially believed the benefits of athletics lay primarily in participation and personal growth, rather than in winning titles, which she assumed were the domain of larger schools. However, her perspective began to shift as she witnessed the dedication and determination of the head coach, Tamara Karcher, and her assistant, Steven Rabinowitz, who tirelessly motivated the players to overcome numerous challenges. Ms. Karcher, in particular, faced several logistical hurdles, such as securing playing fields for practice and games. One memorable incident involved a man who refused to leave a dugout, necessitating police intervention to resolve the situation. Although this ordeal was unpleasant for the team, it underscored the persistent issues they encountered in maintaining access to adequate facilities. Despite these challenges, Ms. Page came to appreciate the resilience and teamwork fostered by the sports program, recognizing that its true value extended beyond mere participation and growth, potentially even towards achieving competitive success.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "Patricia Lockwood sat reading quietly as life unfolded around her at gate B6, where her attention was drawn to a peculiar sight that would later become a moment of unexpected solace. A couple, sporting matching mullets, engaged in an intimate ritual of brushing each other's hair, their synchronicity creating a touching display of affection that somehow lifted the weight of despondency from the observing woman's shoulders. As she watched them, her mind wandered to her own struggles with writing, grappling with the authenticity of words once they left the safety of her thoughts and entered the public sphere. The atmosphere shifted when a twenty-three-year-old influencer took the seat beside her, their shared understanding of the digital world creating an instant connection, marked by enthusiastic high-fives and animated conversation about their online experiences. Later, as Patricia stood before a crowd, she attempted to articulate a theory, but the words seemed to slip away like sand through her fingers, leaving her thoughts scattered and incomplete. The narrative then transported her to Vienna, where she found herself immersed in the city's architectural harmony, savoring rich cakes while admiring buildings that appeared to mirror one another in an endless architectural dialogue. The peaceful moment was interrupted during a ride on a Ferris wheel, as her phone buzzed with an urgent message from her mother, the content of which immediately cast a shadow over the otherwise serene experience. This sequence of events, moving from the intimate scene at the airport to the public speaking engagement and finally to the distant city of Vienna, wove together themes of connection, communication, and the unexpected ways in which moments of joy and concern could intersect in one's life, all while maintaining a delicate balance between personal observation and public performance.",

She sat there with one foot off the edge of the earth, close to falling, until she saw the couple with matching extravagant mullets that hung down past their shoulder blades. The man took out a brush and began to fight through his mullet until it was free, and then he handed the brush to his wife and she began to fight through hers with the same consecrated look; these mullets were their acre and when God came down he would not find a rock, a stump, a weed. They shook out their hair together, as if it were all on the same head, joined hands, and rested.

A couple, sporting matching mullets, engaged in an intimate ritual of brushing each other's hair, their synchronicity creating a touching display of affection that somehow lifted the weight of despondency from the observing woman's shoulders. As she watched them, her mind wandered to her own struggles with writing, grappling with the authenticity of words once they left the safety of her thoughts and entered the public sphere. The atmosphere shifted when a twenty-three-year-old influencer took the seat beside her, their shared understanding of the digital world creating an instant connection, marked by enthusiastic high-fives and animated conversation about their online experiences. Later, as Patricia stood before a crowd, she attempted to articulate a theory, but the words seemed to slip away like sand through her fingers, leaving her thoughts scattered and incomplete. The narrative then transported her to Vienna, where she found herself immersed in the city's architectural harmony, savoring rich cakes while admiring buildings that appeared to mirror one another in an endless architectural dialogue. The peaceful moment was interrupted during a ride on a Ferris wheel, as her phone buzzed with an urgent message from her mother, the content of which immediately cast a shadow over the otherwise serene experience. This sequence of events, moving from the intimate scene at the airport to the public speaking engagement and finally to the distant city of Vienna, wove together themes of connection, communication, and the unexpected ways in which moments of joy and concern could intersect in one's life, all while maintaining a delicate balance between personal observation and public performance.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAudio: Patricia Lockwood reads. Everyone at gate B6 was bathed in gold. She sat there with one foot off the edge of the earth, close to falling, until she saw the couple with matching extravagant mullets that hung down past their shoulder blades. The man took out a brush and began to fight through his mullet until it was free, and then he handed the brush to his wife and she began to fight through hers with the same consecrated look; these mullets were their acre and when God came down he would not find a rock, a stump, a weed. They shook out their hair together, as if it were all on the same head, joined hands, and rested. She sat in the gold that made them the same and felt a little less like dying. \u2022 The cursor blinked where her mind was. She put one true word after another and put the words in the portal.

The death of her father three weeks ago had thrust her into a world populated by relatives she'd never known existed \u2013 her Aunt Marie and Uncle Jerry Brickner \u2013 whose sudden appearance in her life felt like characters stepping out of a book she'd never meant to read. Uncle Jerry, with his forced smiles and awkward attempts at conversation over breakfast, seemed to be trying too hard to bridge a gap that felt more like a chasm to Louisa, his questions about her school preferences and favorite foods landing like pebbles tossed into a deep well, echoing but never quite reaching the bottom. The room they'd prepared for her was thoughtfully arranged, she had to admit, with watercolors, colored pencils, and pristine sketchbooks laid out as if in anticipation of an artist's touch, but it was the collection of dolls on the shelf that truly caught her attention. Their tiny, perfect features and miniature clothes transported her back to the dollhouse her father had crafted for her sixth birthday \u2013 a labor of love that had taken him months to complete, with its hand-painted walls and tiny furniture he'd carved himself. She remembered how she'd spent countless hours arranging and rearranging the diminutive rooms, creating elaborate stories for the tiny family that lived there, each piece of furniture holding its own significance in her carefully constructed world. That dollhouse had been her sanctuary, a place where she could control every aspect of life in a way that real life never allowed, and now, sitting in this room filled with well-meaning strangers' attempts to make her feel at home, she longed for that sense of control again. The art supplies and dolls, while generous gestures from her aunt and uncle, served as bittersweet reminders of a life she'd lost, a life where her father's presence had made even the smallest spaces feel like home. Now, surrounded by these new possessions in this unfamiliar room, Louisa felt more than ever like a doll herself, placed carefully in a new house but somehow not quite belonging to the scene around her.",

At first, he was open to treatment, his medical records show. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m driving my friends away,\u201d he told a therapist in 2018, when he was 26. \u201cI used to be able to talk to people,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re not interested.\u201d In that session, he told the therapist about the family tragedy, a reservoir of pain he had walled off for years. When he was 8, he watched his twin sister, Sasha, drown in a duck pond in a neighbor\u2019s yard. The children were alone. He had tried to save her. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it to exhaustion,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve incorporated her into these stories I make up.\u201d\n\nParagraph 2:\nAndrey, once a vibrant part of the stoner bohemian community in the Pacific Northwest, found himself adrift as he transitioned from a promising yet indolent high school student to a young adult struggling to find his footing. Surrounded by a tight circle of gamer friends, Andrey was known for his sharp intellect and laid-back demeanor. However, as the years passed, he found himself caught in a cycle of transient minimum-wage jobs, his lack of direction becoming a growing concern for his friends, Sam and Olga. Both stage hands by profession, Sam and Olga worried about Andrey's future and endeavored to help by introducing him to their line of work. Despite their best efforts, Andrey's erratic behavior began to surface, resulting in a series of work-related incidents that raised red flags. Recognizing the need for professional help, Sam and Olga gently encouraged Andrey to see a therapist. During a pivotal session in 2018, Andrey bravely shared a harrowing experience from his past\u2014the traumatic memory of his twin sister Sasha's drowning when they were just eight years old. This unresolved grief had cast a long shadow over his life, manifesting in the stories he crafted as a means of keeping Sasha's memory alive and managing his profound loss. Acknowledging this deep-seated pain marked a turning point for Andrey, offering a glimmer of hope for healing and a path toward reclaiming his future.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Jackie lived in a house just a few doors down from my apartment, and while others saw him as rough and mean, I had a peculiar ability to calm him, much like one would soothe a stray dog. Jackie had a troubled home life, which I believed contributed significantly to his behavior. His mother had passed away, leaving him in the care of a father who was not only abusive but also saw Jackie as little more than a burden. This harsh view was matched by his stepmother, May, who did nothing to ease the burden of his upbringing. In our neighborhood, all the children, myself included, were no strangers to physical discipline. Our parents were laborers, hardened by their own struggles, and saw physical discipline as a necessary tool for raising their children. The nuns at school were no different, perpetuating a culture of violence that trickled down to us kids. But Jackie\u2019s father took it to extremes, treating Jackie as an adversary rather than a son. This harshness was a defining factor in Jackie\u2019s contentious demeanor. He wasn\u2019t born a bully; rather, he was molded by the relentless challenges of his family dynamics and the unforgiving environment we all inhabited. While other children responded to their harsh realities with varying degrees of acceptance or rebellion, Jackie lashed out, perhaps as a defense mechanism against a world that seemed constantly against him. I understood this, perhaps more than anyone else, and it allowed me to connect with him in a way that defied his usual behavior. Our interactions were like a quiet truce amidst the chaos, moments where Jackie seemed to find a sliver of peace. I imagined that in those rare instances, he could momentarily escape the adversarial world he lived in. Our neighborhood was a place where the adults\u2019 struggles bled into the lives of the children, creating a cycle of hardship that seemed unbreakable. Yet, despite the bleakness of our surroundings, I found a strange kinship with Jackie. Though he was often feared, I couldn\u2019t help but see the scared, hurt boy beneath the tough exterior. It was this understanding that drove me to approach him with empathy rather than fear, and in doing so, I discovered the power of compassion in the face of adversity. Jackie\u2019s story was a reminder that behind every tough demeanor lies a narrative of struggle, and sometimes, all it takes is a little kindness to uncover the vulnerability hidden beneath.

She felt a growing sense of unease as she wondered if the vehicle was up to the task, her anxiety spiking as her phone lost reception and the road came to an abrupt end. But she recalled Charles's advice to park and walk from here, and so she reluctantly shut off the engine and stepped out into the stillness. The woods seemed to swallow her whole, the silence so profound it was almost eerie, but as she made her way down the winding path, a clearing emerged and with it, Angela's cozy A-frame cottage, its wooden slats weathered to a soft silver.

    "paragraph1": "\u201cSmall Things Like These\u201d plays just a little like a gangster film, except the web of power at its center is spun by nuns. Set in 1985 and based on Claire Keegan\u2019s 2021 novel, it is a story about how people create and maintain control and the many shades of complicity that result. In this case, the setting is southeast Ireland, and the nuns\u2019 control has woven its way into every aspect of life in a small town. Bill Furlong (Cillian Murphy) sells and delivers coal and fuel in that town, an occupation that barely supports his wife, Eileen (Eileen Walsh), and a house full of daughters. But they\u2019re doing OK. He can put food on the table, and they have a happy home life. One day, however, something changes inside Bill: He sees a young woman being nearly dragged into a building near the local convent, and it troubles him. He suspects that she is pregnant and unmarried, like his own mother was, and is being brought to the nuns by her horrified family. She is, quite literally, kicking and screaming. Bill can\u2019t stop thinking about her.",
    "paragraph2": "In the quiet, rural landscape of southeast Ireland in 1985, a subtle yet profound transformation is underway in the life of Bill Furlong, a humble coal and fuel seller. Played with nuanced intensity by Cillian Murphy, Bill navigates the intricate web of relationships in his small town, where the nuns wield considerable influence over the community. At home, Bill finds comfort in the loving companionship of his wife, Eileen (Eileen Walsh), and their daughters, their modest means notwithstanding. However, the tranquility of Bill's existence is disrupted when he witnesses a disturbing scene: a young woman, suspected to be unmarried and pregnant, is forcibly taken into a building near the local convent. The woman's desperate resistance and evident distress leave an indelible mark on Bill, stirring a deep sense of empathy and recognition. As he grapples with the implications of what he has seen, Bill's thoughts turn to his own mother's past, and the seeds of a quiet rebellion are sown.",

Set in 1985 and based on Claire Keegan\u2019s 2021 novel, it is a story about how people create and maintain control and the many shades of complicity that result. In this case, the setting is southeast Ireland, and the nuns\u2019 control has woven its way into every aspect of life in a small town. Bill Furlong (Cillian Murphy) sells and delivers coal and fuel in that town, an occupation that barely supports his wife, Eileen (Eileen Walsh), and a house full of daughters. But they\u2019re doing OK. He can put food on the table, and they have a happy home life. One day, however, something changes inside Bill: He sees a young woman being nearly dragged into a building near the local convent, and it troubles him. He suspects that she is pregnant and unmarried, like his own mother was, and is being brought to the nuns by her horrified family. She is, quite literally, kicking and screaming. Bill can\u2019t stop thinking about her.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn the quiet, rural landscape of southeast Ireland in 1985, a subtle yet profound transformation is underway in the life of Bill Furlong, a humble coal and fuel seller. Played with nuanced intensity by Cillian Murphy, Bill navigates the intricate web of relationships in his small town, where the nuns wield considerable influence over the community. At home, Bill finds comfort in the loving companionship of his wife, Eileen (Eileen Walsh), and their daughters, their modest means notwithstanding. However, the tranquility of Bill's existence is disrupted when he witnesses a disturbing scene: a young woman, suspected to be unmarried and pregnant, is forcibly taken into a building near the local convent. The woman's desperate resistance and evident distress leave an indelible mark on Bill, stirring a deep sense of empathy and recognition. As he grapples with the implications of what he has seen, Bill's thoughts turn to his own mother's past, and the seeds of a quiet rebellion are sown.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It looked as if a flock of quarrelsome crows had flown in through an open window, gorged themselves, and flown away again. The only thing untouched was the vase of lilies; had there been less food, he might have devoured them as well.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

As I immerse myself in its rhythm and melody, I find myself transported to a mental realm where life's significance shifts, becoming both more and less than I previously imagined. There's a transformative power in the music that unveils hidden truths and possibilities, whispering secrets that feel both personal and universal. I feel an immense gratitude for this gift, for the way it gently nudges me to view the world through a different lens, where the mundane becomes magical and the complex becomes simple. It is as if Mr. Jackson has unlocked a door to another dimension, inviting me and my son to step through and explore the boundless potential of our existence. I often find myself pondering the magic behind Mr. Jackson's artistry, questioning how he manages to create music that resonates so deeply with the listener. How does he craft something that feels so intimately personal, yet speaks to the collective human experience? This mystery is part of what makes the song so powerful; it touches the soul, stirring emotions that lie dormant and awakening a sense of wonder that is both exhilarating and humbling. As the music plays, I watch my son, mesmerized, as he too is swept away by its beauty, and I am reminded of the universal language of music that connects us all. Together, we are caught in the spell of \"URML,\" carried along a journey that defies time, where past, present, and future merge into a single, harmonious moment.

She laughed, and put her hands on her hips. She wore bruised sneakers and no socks, and when she opened her mouth Ray could see gaps in her teeth, most of her molars missing. She raised one hand, clapping a cigarette to her lips, then blew smoke at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d \u201cIs it\u2014\u201d He squinted to remember the name. \u201cLouise?\u201d \u201cWho else?\u201d she said, then, \u201cWho\u2019s that\u2014your daughter?\u201d and laughed again.\n\nParagraph 2:\nRay found himself wide awake after a wrong number call jostled him from his slumber. Unable to return to sleep, he decided to revisit his old neighborhood later that day, taking Shelby along for company. As he navigated the familiar streets, Ray shared snippets of his past with Shelby, pointing out places that held significant memories for him, including a spot where he once experienced an unforgettable encounter with a girl from his youth. Despite his efforts to engage her, Shelby seemed largely uninterested, her eyes glazing over as Ray recounted tales of his past. Their stroll through the neighborhood took an unexpected turn when they encountered Louise, a woman who recognized Ray immediately. Louise, a large woman with wild, unkempt hair, wore worn sneakers and flashed a smile that revealed several missing teeth. Her familiarity with Ray was evident as she approached them with humor, mistakenly assuming that Shelby was Ray's daughter. The encounter, though brief, was filled with laughter and light-hearted banter, as Louise's jovial nature momentarily lifted the veil of indifference that Shelby wore. Ray found himself chuckling at Louise's mistaken assumption, appreciating her ability to inject humor into the day. Despite Shelby's lack of enthusiasm, Ray felt a sense of nostalgia and connection to his past, brought to life by the vibrant characters and memories that inhabited his old neighborhood. As they continued their walk, Ray couldn't help but reflect on the unexpected twists that life often presented.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

He had spent days in the library thinking about what he would say to her, drawing the map and the heavenly host on the flyleaf of a big travel book that had not been checked out for years, since before the war, and then only twice. The page pulled loose from its binding very cleanly.\u00a0Whenever his father had found one of his drawings, he\u2019d say, \u201cHe\u2019s the clever one. He\u2019s going to surprise us all one day.\u201d He heard his mother say once, \u201cI guess you\u2019re never going to give up on him.\u201d His father seemed to consider, and then he said, \u201cI\u2019m just not sure there would be any point in it.\u201d But the angels went well\u2014they were fat and buoyant, cumulous. Della had to like them, he thought. And she did. Cleverness has a special piquancy when it blooms out of the fraying sleeve of failure. That was his experience, the magic trick he could usually play when he had to. And here she was. He said, \u201cNew tie,\u201d when he realized he was smoothing it. She smiled and said, \u201cNew hat.\u201d He was in love with her. That did it. That hat brought out glints of rose in the warm dark of her skin. Women know that kind of thing. She, Della, wanted him, Jack, to see that particular loveliness in her. These thoughts interfered considerably with the efforts at conversation he should have been making. She said, \u201cThat bridge you talk about really is handsome. Those huge stones. The walls of Troy must have looked like that.\u201d \u201cYes. Herod\u2019s temple.\u201d\u00a0Then he said, \u201cHave you ever been to Bellefontaine?\u201d \u201cThe white cemetery? Why, no. I haven\u2019t had much occasion.\u201d Of course.

Where dense forests once stood, only blackened stumps remained, stretching endlessly across the scorched landscape. The destruction was so complete that local residents told us they were discovering geographical features they'd never seen before \u2013 hills, rivers, and even distant towns that had been hidden behind the thick forest canopy. As we navigated the desolate terrain, I couldn't shake the feeling of profound loss. The absence of living trees created an eerie silence, and the stark transformation of this once-vibrant ecosystem left me deeply alarmed about the future of these ancient woodlands.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs a reporter, I\u2019ve experienced the aftermath of several disasters, including dam bursts, landslides and floods. But nothing quite prepared me to witness the extent of the destruction in Canada\u2019s boreal forests that I saw in June, one year after the record-breaking wildfires of 2023. At one point, my colleague Bryan Denton and I drove for an entire hour and saw almost no living trees in the forests we could see from the road. Much of the landscape was covered with blackened stumps of trees that burned last year. Residents told us the burned trees revealed hills, rivers and towns that they had never seen before.

When they first started dating, they\u2019d agreed that if there weren\u2019t any glaring red flags, and there weren\u2019t, they would try to live together, and they did. To make things fair, each tried to find a job in the other\u2019s city. Not surprisingly, the demand for financial analysts in New York was much higher than the demand for pottery instructors in Boston. Huzzah, he texted the day the movers arrived at her old apartment. She texted back a smiley face, then, later, pictures of her empty living room, bedroom, bathroom, and the pile of furniture and things she was donating so that, once they were living together, they would not have, for example, two dining-room sets, twenty pots and pans, seven paring knives, and so on.\n\nParagraph 2:\nJohn gave Sarah a reassuring glance across the dimly lit restaurant table, his eyes conveying that she should relax and enjoy herself despite her visible apprehension about the establishment's food safety standards. \"If you get sick, I'll take full responsibility,\" he quipped with a gentle smile, attempting to lighten her mood. The waitress, who had been intently studying her freshly manicured nails, finally acknowledged their presence with a cursory nod and gestured toward the bar area before vanishing behind a heavy velvet curtain. Their presence in this questionable establishment was just another step in their carefully planned journey together, having decided to cohabitate only after methodically ensuring they were compatible in all major aspects of life. The transition hadn't been simple; both had explored job opportunities in each other's cities, but ultimately, John's position as a financial analyst in New York proved more practical than Sarah's work as a pottery instructor in Boston. As she prepared for the move, Sarah had kept him updated with a steady stream of texts \u2013 snapshots of her increasingly empty apartment, lists of items she was donating to avoid duplicates in their shared space, and the bittersweet process of dismantling her independent life to build something new together.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

There was something deeply comforting about the predictability of our office interactions, the clear communication and expectations that allowed me to gradually build confidence in my abilities.

My mother drove me to interviews for maybe a week before I found a secretarial position that didn\u2019t require experience, working for a lawyer in Westland named Ned Johnson. The office was in a small house, brick, with stiff fir trees on either side of the door and a flower box under the window. My mother waited in the car while I went to the door. Ned Johnson was there by himself.

He was a short, thick-bodied man with deep, shining, active eyes. I was startled by him without knowing why. During the interview, I said weird things I wouldn\u2019t normally say. He told me that the job was dull, and I said, \u201cI like dull work.\u201d He stared as if he were insulted, and I thought the interview was over\u2014but instead he said something weird. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s something off about you.

She said I could start tomorrow if it was convenient. My parents were really happy. I remember my father smiling, holding a can of beer and some peanuts; there was something special for dessert.

The furniture, too, was comically mismatched, and there was too much of it for the low-ceilinged rectangular room: two cheap swollen couches faced each other before my grossly big oak desk, which itself pointlessly faced two haughty high-backed armchairs, positioned as if for an important meeting that never took place. But I liked the strange furniture. It made the lawyer seem more human because it offset his extreme consistency, his choppy economical movements, his always shining eyes. His style of training was loud and cheerful, full of stressful encouragement.

When she was next on the list, he would open his door and say, \u201cThere\u2019s my girlfriend!,\u201d and she would rise and wobble toward him with fierce, caneless dignity.

Instead, researchers utilize the decay of radioactive carbon-14 in organic materials to approximate the age of archaeological sites. This radiocarbon dating technique is instrumental in tracing population changes, as it allows scientists to infer the size of human groups from the amount of physical evidence they leave behind.

She articulates how societies typically do not undergo total collapse over time. Instead, researchers utilize the decay of radioactive carbon-14 in organic materials to approximate the age of archaeological sites. This radiocarbon dating technique is instrumental in tracing population changes, as it allows scientists to infer the size of human groups from the amount of physical evidence they leave behind.

The straps chafed, and Max squirmed and kicked, sometimes he cried, but mostly, as they travelled, he spoke softly to the doll. In the afternoon, they passed the lake. A victory. Of course, there was only more forest, all the same. She built a fire beneath an overhanging rock; she ate jerky and apologized to Max for not feeding him. He pouted but then wandered off, picking up sticks and digging with them in the earth. The sun set. They sang to Quinn: I\u2019ll see you in the mo-or-ning. In the night, she woke and felt Max breathing against her. They followed the sun, so she called it west. Sometimes the hills they climbed would level and drop limply back down; other times, they\u2019d break through the tree line to bare rocky stretches, where eagles skimmed overhead. They travelled along a mountain ridge, two beautiful days, but had to double back when they came to a high chasm: no way down. That afternoon, they saw black bears, three of them, nosing along the mountainside. She shifted Max so he could see and said, \u201cBears.\u201d She stewed and ate nettles; she kicked mushrooms from tree trunks and roasted them.

No more big pines, only firs, growing shorter and sparser, until\u2014it happened so gradually she barely noticed\u2014they were out of the forest. The soil turned sandy and pale. Before them was nothing. Nothing whatsoever. Now and then, she\u2019d look back: the forest\u2019s edge, like a wall, and the mountains looming over it, clouds and sky above the peaks, all together like something in a fishbowl. She walked until it was only a green-blue smear, and then nothing. And then they were nowhere. On her back, Max was quiet and still. The sand was soft and felt nice on her feet. It faded to a dirty white, like smudged paper, and so did the horizon. When the lack of perspective made her dizzy, she walked with her eyes shut. They had no fires. She ran out of water. Sometimes Max whispered things in her ear. Then the last trace of gray was gone from the sand. It was fine and synthetic-feeling; when displaced, it whirled in the air with unnatural lightness. The sky darkened, and the air grew thinner; it tasted like plastic. Then the only light was behind her, as if she were walking into a cave. And soon they were in total darkness. O.K., she thought. What now. She sat down, slipped the backpack\u2019s straps over her arms, and found the lighter. Briefly, it lit the space around them. She pulled Max from her back, curled up with him, and fell asleep. When she woke, he was gone. She felt for the lighter and couldn\u2019t find it; the darkness jumped before her eyes. But then she calmed herself: he couldn\u2019t have gone far. She angled her head to listen, in one direction, then another, and on hands and knees she found the place where the sand went smooth again. In rigid, deliberate movements she crawled out, feeling with her fingers, counting each motion away from the backpack, and then returning. Wider each time, a spiral. Finally she felt a divot in the sand ahead of her, and then another. She followed the indentations out, slow and careful, the blood loud in her ears. Her fingertips found Max\u2019s cloth diaper, and then his back, his shoulders, the nape of his neck; she went into a crouch and drew her arms around him. Only later did it terrify her: he\u2019d been sitting perfectly still, staring into the dark. Back out in the light, it was the first thing she noticed: \u201cMax. Where is Quinn?\u201d She dug through the pack. \u201cQuinn,\u201d he said. She looked toward the dark, then at him, and fell into wild sobs.",

The forest canopy filtered the sunlight, creating a dappled pattern on the leaf-strewn ground as Max's small hands occasionally reached out to grasp at low-hanging branches and colorful leaves, his delighted giggles breaking the otherwise eerie silence. As they ventured deeper into the wilderness, she remained vigilant, her eyes scanning the undergrowth for any signs of movement, knowing that various creatures called these woods home. Max would sometimes engage in animated conversations with Quinn, pulling the doll from the backpack to show it interesting findings like peculiar stones or vibrant mushrooms, while she carefully rationed their dwindling supplies, making mental notes of edible plants and water sources they encountered. The forest gradually began to thin, the lush vegetation giving way to scraggly bushes and eventually bare earth, until they found themselves at the edge of a vast, sandy expanse that stretched endlessly before them. The transition was jarring, like stepping from one world into another, and she hesitated before pressing forward into this barren landscape where the wind whispered strange songs and the sand shifted beneath their feet in unpredictable patterns. As darkness descended, the environment took on an increasingly surreal quality, with shadows bending in impossible ways and the horizon seeming to pulse and breathe like a living entity. Her exhaustion mounted as she struggled to maintain her bearings in this disorienting terrain, the weight of Max and their supplies becoming nearly unbearable. In a moment of confusion, amid swirling sand and deceiving darkness, she realized with horror that she could no longer feel Max's presence against her back. Panic seized her heart as she spun around, calling out his name into the void, until her eyes finally found him sitting perfectly still in the sand, his small figure illuminated by a strange, ambient light. Relief flooded through her as she rushed to gather him in her arms, but as they emerged from the darkness into a patch of clearer visibility, her hand instinctively reached for the front pocket of her backpack, finding it empty. Quinn, Max's constant companion and sole source of comfort in this harsh world, was gone, lost somewhere in the vast expanse of sand and shadow they had traversed. The realization hit her like a physical blow, and she collapsed to her knees, hot tears streaming down her face as Max looked on in confusion. The doll had been more than just a plaything; it had been a symbol of normalcy, a small piece of childhood preserved in a world that seemed determined to strip away all innocence and joy. She held Max close as she wept, knowing that they would have to press on without Quinn, another small loss in a journey marked by countless sacrifices, yet this one felt particularly cruel. The wind continued to blow across the desolate landscape, carrying with it the ghost of children's laughter and the memory of simpler times, as she gathered her strength to stand once more, adjusting Max's weight on her back and facing the uncertain path ahead with renewed determination, though her heart ached for the small comfort they had lost in the unforgiving darkness.",

When Rafik brought afternoon tea into the living room, K.K. could hear the typewriter clacking in the background. It stopped, and then Husna knocked. She opened the door, showing her head without entering. \u201cCome in, my dear.\u201d Husna\u2019s cultivation of Rafik had progressed to the point where he included an extra cup on the tea trolley. She drew herself forward and made K.K.\u2019s tea exactly as he liked it. A boy passed a plate of biscuits, while Rafik stood back on his heels by the door. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here,\u201d Husna said, \u201ceverything is so nice and everyone is pleasant. These biscuits, the tea. Shah Sahib tries so hard to teach me the typing, though I can\u2019t seem to learn.\u201d She held out her hands and spread her fingers in front of him, like a cat stretching. \u201cMy hands are so tiny, I can\u2019t reach the keys. But then all of me is small.\u201d She wore a tight kurta, showing the cleft of her breasts, which jutted out from her muscular youthful torso. Their eyes met; they both saw the joke, and he allowed himself a tight-lipped smile, his composed expression becoming avid and boyish. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling you about,\u201d Husna purred, putting her hand on his arm. \u201cYour crocodile smile, the one I like.\u201d After pausing for a moment, she lowered her eyes and said in a meek voice, \u201cBut soon I won\u2019t be able to come here. The begum is going on umrah, so I\u2019ll have to be in charge of her house.\u201d \u201cNot umrah again!\u201d K.K. said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a vice with her.

It was six weeks after her initial walk with K.K. that Begum Harouni announced her plans to embark on a pilgrimage, an event that would temporarily upend the household's routine.

As they spoke, Husna busied herself making Harouni's tea, her small hands moving deftly as she worked. She joked about her inability to type, a lighthearted remark that caught Harouni off guard and led to a moment of shared amusement between them. Despite the begum's absence, Husna expressed worry about not being able to visit the household, but K.K. was quick to reassure her, insisting that she was welcome to visit even more frequently.

Like her parents, she would have thought the term \u201cmobile home\u201d pretentious. Some people lived in trailers, and that was all there was to it. One trailer was no different from another. When she moved in here, when she chose this life with Clark, she began to see things in a new way. After that, it was only the mobile homes that she really looked at, to see how people had fixed them up\u2014the kind of curtains they had hung, the way they had painted the trim, the ambitious decks or patios or extra rooms they had built on. She could hardly wait to get to such improvements herself. Clark had gone along with her ideas for a while. He had built new steps, and spent a lot of time looking for an old wrought-iron railing for them. He hadn\u2019t complained about the money spent on paint for the kitchen and bathroom or the material for curtains. What he did balk at was tearing up the carpet, which was the same in every room and the thing that she had most counted on replacing. It was divided into small brown squares, each with a pattern of darker brown, rust, and tan squiggles and shapes. For a long time, she had thought that the same squiggles and shapes were arranged the same way in each square. Then, when she had had more time, a lot of time, to examine them, she decided that there were four patterns joined together to make identical larger squares. Sometimes she could pick out the arrangement easily and sometimes she had to work to see it. She did this at times when Clark\u2019s mood had weighted down all their indoor space. The best thing then was to invent or remember some job to do in the barn. The horses would not look at her when she was unhappy, but Flora, who was never tied up, would come and rub against her, and look up with an expression that was not quite sympathy; it was more like comradely mockery in her shimmering yellow-green eyes.",

Each trailer seemed to tell a story, reflecting the unique tastes and personalities of its occupants.

It was during these moments that the indoor environment felt stifling, pushing Carla to seek refuge in the barn.

This morning felt different, charged with an energy that compelled Toni to shake up their routine. Inspired by her own cherished childhood memories, she decided to take Amalie to a doughnut shop before school, a place that held its own kind of magic.

Toni felt a surge of ambition and protectiveness as she watched Amalie, who seemed so small yet so full of potential, a little girl with dreams as vast as the night sky.

With a contented sigh, they returned to the car, the morning sun casting a golden hue over them.

He couldn't shake the feeling that it was going to be a disaster, what with Robert's lack of practice and the fact that they didn't even have a real piano at home. The makeshift cardboard keyboard he had crafted for Robert to practice on had been a valiant effort, but it had ultimately fallen victim to his daughter Annie's voracious appetite. Morse's thoughts swirled with strategies to encourage Robert to practice, but every time he considered being more forceful, he was met with a pang of hesitation - he simply couldn't bear the thought of seeing Robert upset. As he stood there, his brow furrowed in worry, Morse's body began to betray his inner turmoil, his shoulders tensing and his jaw clenched in a futile attempt to ward off the stress that was building inside him.

Please put the stick down and go inside your house for now.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs they fled through the woods, the group of boys, including the pair of twins and Wayne, could hear the snapping of twigs and the labored breathing of Eykelboom's father as he pursued them, his stick at the ready. The younger twin, his legs pumping furiously as he struggled to keep up, failed to notice the barbed wire stretching across their path and tripped, his palms scraping against the rough earth. His brother quickly pulled him to his feet, and they continued running, their eyes scanning the trees for any sign of their friend Eykelboom, who had also fled to escape his father's wrath. For what felt like an hour, they searched the woods, their calls of \"Eykelboom!\" going unanswered. Eventually, they made their way back to the street, where they were met with an ominous sight: a police cruiser parked in front of the Eykelbooms' house, its lights flashing lazily. Eykelboom's father stood on the porch, his face twisted in anger as he spoke with a police officer. The boys approached cautiously, their eyes fixed on the stick still clutched in Eykelboom's father's hand. \"You're the ones who've been hurting my boy,\" he spat, his eyes flashing with accusation. Wayne stepped forward, his face set in a defiant expression. \"That's not true,\" he said, his voice steady. \"You're the one who's been beating him. That's why he ran away.\" The police officer intervened, his voice firm but calm. \"Put the stick down, sir. Let's go inside and talk about this.\" Eykelboom's father hesitated, his grip on the stick tightening before he finally relinquished it, his eyes never leaving the group of boys. The officer turned to the boys. \"You kids okay?\" he asked, his eyes scanning their faces. \"Do any of you know where Eykelboom is?\" The boys shook their heads, their faces somber with worry. As they stood there, the only sound the quiet hum of the police cruiser, they couldn't help but wonder what would happen next.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

When I was in charge of preparing Astra\u2019s food, I chopped everything so finely I admit I might as well have blended it or hit it with a hammer, which is not what I was supposed to be doing, I was supposed to be giving her an experience of texture, as Inma kept pointing out\u2014\u201cShe has to learn what she likes; she has to learn to use her teeth\u201d\u2014and since Inma\u2019s mother was over many times a week she often witnessed Inma remarking that I\u2019d inadvertently liquefied Astra\u2019s food, and of course Inma\u2019s mom silently sided with Inma, forming a triangle; I was the neurotic cracker with no experience caring for children who was trying to micromanage the steamed carrots, the hot dogs (which, thankfully, Astra didn\u2019t really like), and the grapes. Because Inma\u2019s mom had taught kindergarten (she\u2019d recently retired), I\u2019d hoped she might share the intensity of my concern about Astra choking\u2014surely there had been trainings about these things\u2014but although both Inma and her mother were incredibly conscientious caretakers in general, so graceful and competent with Astra that I felt bumbling in comparison, and although they watched her closely when she ate, the fear of her choking quickly became my thing, the worry I carried that carried all of my other worries: I would pulverize the food and they would not quite slice it properly, which is the way of polarization. When Inma\u2019s mom was sitting with Astra at the table, it was less that I watched over them than that my effort not to was palpable, and if Inma or her mom was cutting something for Astra I perceived a slight exaggeration in their gestures, a trace of performativity that said, See how tiny these pieces are? Do we have your permission to feed her? It was a clich\u00e9, this tension around the child\u2019s eating, the triangulation, etc., but I was finding small, mortally uncut grapes in the purple plastic snack container Inma\u2019s mom took with Astra to the park, and large grapes on the high chair that were cut in half but never lengthwise (anyway, they should be quartered), and then I\u2019d confront Inma about it, as if it were her fault, demanding she talk to her mom, and before we knew it we would be having a spectacular fight, scaling up from the grapes to questions of power, labor, value, the possibility of love, Astra crying when we yelled (or, worse, taking it all in silently, blinking her large brown eyes). We\u2019d had one such fight only a month or two before I choked. And it was only when I choked, while I was standing there choking at Caf\u00e9 Loup, that I fully realized (although not in these words) that our polarization around the grapes issued from our conflicting but, in fact, equally magical beliefs about the effects of my voicing, again and again, my fear of Astra choking. Inma would of course agree that the food should be cut up, but the intensity of my focus on this particular risk, the repetitive articulation of my concerns\u2014reading statistics off my phone (\u201cLast year alone, every child in America choked to death\u201d), showing with my thumb and index finger the tiny diameter of a child\u2019s windpipe\u2014was, in Inma\u2019s mind, courting disaster.

One particular memory stands out vividly\u2014receiving a small, unassuming paperweight as a child. At first glance, it seemed like a simple object, but for me, it represented much more. It was a metaphor for the complex and intricate history of my family, a history that I have spent countless hours contemplating. I often liken our family history to grapes, each grape representing a story, a life, a moment in time that has contributed to the vast vineyard of our shared past. This metaphorical vineyard is both beautiful and burdensome, as it carries the weight of generations of love, struggle, and resilience. Nowadays, my reflections on family history are often intertwined with my anxieties about my child, Astra. I find myself consumed by an obsessive fear that Astra might choke on food\u2014a fear that has taken root deep within me and grown into a pervasive worry that I cannot seem to shake. This fear has become a point of tension between my partner, Inma, and me, as well as with Inma's mother, who frequently sides with Inma in our disagreements. Inma and I have different approaches to parenting, and my anxiety over Astra choking often leads to arguments that seem to encompass broader issues of power and love within our relationship. Inma believes that I am overly cautious and that my fears are unfounded, while I feel that my concerns are valid and that I am simply trying to protect our child. This conflict is further complicated by the involvement of Inma's mother, whose opinions often add fuel to the fire. She seems to view my concerns as an overreaction, aligning herself with Inma's more relaxed approach. In these moments, I feel isolated and misunderstood, my fears dismissed as irrational. However, my anxiety is very real to me, and it manifests in various ways, from meticulously cutting Astra's food into tiny, manageable pieces to constantly watching for any signs of distress while she eats. It's as though my fear of choking has become a focal point of my life, a lens through which I view my role as a parent and protector. This fear has caused me to question my abilities and has led to moments of self-doubt and insecurity. Despite the tension it creates, I cannot simply ignore what feels like an ever-present danger. Then, one day, I found myself in a situation that forced me to confront my own fears in a very personal way. I was enjoying a meal when, suddenly, I began to choke. In those terrifying moments, I realized how fragile life truly is and how easily the unexpected can occur. As I struggled to breathe, it dawned on me that my fear of Astra choking was not just about the act itself but about the vulnerability and lack of control that it represented. This incident served as a catalyst for introspection and self-awareness, prompting me to reconsider the dynamics at play in my relationship with Inma. I began to see that our differing beliefs about voicing fears were at the heart of many of our conflicts. Inma tends to approach life with a sense of optimism and trust, believing that voicing fears gives them power and life. In contrast, I have always felt that expressing my fears is a way to confront and manage them, to prepare for the worst so that I am not caught off guard. Our opposing viewpoints have led to misunderstandings and arguments, each of us convinced that our way is the right way. Through this experience, I realized that perhaps there is no right or wrong way, but rather a need for balance and understanding. I understood that my fear, while valid, should not overshadow the joy and spontaneity of life. Similarly, Inma's optimism should be tempered with caution and preparedness. This newfound understanding has not magically resolved our differences, but it has opened the door to more open and empathetic communication. It has allowed me to express my fears in a way that invites dialogue rather than defensiveness, and it has encouraged Inma to acknowledge my concerns without dismissing them outright. As we continue to navigate the challenges of parenthood and partnership, I am learning to let go of the need for control and to embrace the unpredictability of life. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that I cannot protect Astra from every danger, just as I cannot rewrite the past or alter my family's history. Instead, I can strive to create a nurturing and supportive environment where Astra can grow and thrive, where fears can be voiced and addressed without judgment. This journey is ongoing, and there are still moments of tension and disagreement, but I am hopeful that, with time and patience, we can find a balance that allows us to move forward together, united in our love for Astra and our commitment to one another.",

Larger groups tend to leave more substantial remnants, such as burned wood and food remains, which can be precisely dated, whereas smaller groups leave fewer traces, making their historical footprint less discernible.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

She remembered how she'd spent countless hours arranging and rearranging the diminutive rooms, creating elaborate stories for the tiny family that lived there, each piece of furniture holding its own significance in her carefully constructed world. That dollhouse had been her sanctuary, a place where she could control every aspect of life in a way that real life never allowed, and now, sitting in this room filled with well-meaning strangers' attempts to make her feel at home, she longed for that sense of control again.

He was rough and angry and mean, it was true\u2014a bully. But not to me. I knew how to handle him. I would talk soothingly to him, as if he were a stray dog. I could even pull him off his victims. His body had a sweaty, gooey sensation of unhappy fat. Under him, a boy would beg for mercy, but Jackie, alone in his rage, would be far from the regular world. When I pulled him off, he would continue to flail, at war with ghosts, until, through his hate-filled little eyes, something soft peered out, and, if it was me that he saw, he might sputter some burning explanation and then run home.

Jackie lived in a house just a few doors down from my apartment, and while others saw him as rough and mean, I had a peculiar ability to calm him, much like one would soothe a stray dog. Jackie had a troubled home life, which I believed contributed significantly to his behavior. His mother had passed away, leaving him in the care of a father who was not only abusive but also saw Jackie as little more than a burden. This harsh view was matched by his stepmother, May, who did nothing to ease the burden of his upbringing. In our neighborhood, all the children, myself included, were no strangers to physical discipline. Our parents were laborers, hardened by their own struggles, and saw physical discipline as a necessary tool for raising their children. The nuns at school were no different, perpetuating a culture of violence that trickled down to us kids.

He wasn\u2019t born a bully; rather, he was molded by the relentless challenges of his family dynamics and the unforgiving environment we all inhabited. While other children responded to their harsh realities with varying degrees of acceptance or rebellion, Jackie lashed out, perhaps as a defense mechanism against a world that seemed constantly against him. I understood this, perhaps more than anyone else, and it allowed me to connect with him in a way that defied his usual behavior. Our interactions were like a quiet truce amidst the chaos, moments where Jackie seemed to find a sliver of peace. I imagined that in those rare instances, he could momentarily escape the adversarial world he lived in.

It was this understanding that drove me to approach him with empathy rather than fear, and in doing so, I discovered the power of compassion in the face of adversity. Jackie\u2019s story was a reminder that behind every tough demeanor lies a narrative of struggle, and sometimes, all it takes is a little kindness to uncover the vulnerability hidden beneath.

    "paragraph1": "From that day on, everyone who happened by our room\u2014neighbors wanting to borrow stuff, residential computer staff, student-council candidates, all kinds of people to whom my small enthusiasms should have been a source of little or no concern\u2014went out of their way to disabuse me of my great admiration for Albert Einstein. Einstein had invented the atomic bomb, mistreated dogs, neglected his children. \u201cThere were many greater geniuses than Einstein,\u201d a guy from down the hall, who had stopped by to borrow my copy of Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cThe Double,\u201d said. \u201cAlfred Nobel hated mathematics and didn\u2019t give the Nobel Prize to any mathematicians. There were many who were more deserving.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I handed him the book. \u201cWell, see you around.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, glaring at the poster. \u201cThis is the man who beats his wife, forces her to solve his mathematical problems, and then denies her credit. And you put his picture on your wall.\u201d \u201cListen, leave me out of this,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my poster. It\u2019s a complicated situation.\u201d He wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cEinstein is synonymous with genius in this country, while many greater geniuses aren\u2019t famous at all. Why is this? I am asking you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s really the best, and even jealous mudslingers can\u2019t hide his star quality,\u201d I said. \u201cNietzsche would say that such a great genius is entitled to beat his wife.\u201d That shut him up. After he left, I thought about taking down the poster. I wanted to be a courageous person, uncowed by other people\u2019s dumb opinions. But which was the dumb opinion, thinking Einstein was so great or thinking he was the worst? Hannah and I both caught a terrible cold. We took turns buying cold medicine and knocked it back from the little plastic cup as if we were doing shots. When it came time to choose classes, everyone said it was of utmost importance to apply to freshman seminars, because otherwise it could be years before you had a chance to work with senior faculty.",
    "paragraph2": "As I sit in my room, surrounded by the familiar comforts of my daily life, I've come to realize that it's not just a personal sanctuary, but also a hub for interactions with others who often challenge my perspectives. My admiration for Albert Einstein, for instance, has been a subject of scrutiny for many who visit me. It's as if they feel compelled to disillusion me with negative opinions and so-called \"facts\" about his life and character. I recall a particular encounter with a guy from down the hall who borrowed a book from me, only to criticize the poster of Einstein hanging on my wall. He accused Einstein of being a bad husband and a plagiarist, among other things. I listened patiently, though with a hint of sarcasm, as I defended my admiration for the brilliant physicist. \"So, you're saying I should only admire people who are perfect?\" I asked, trying to hide my frustration. After he left, I couldn't help but wonder if I should take down the poster, not because I believed the criticisms, but because I was tired of justifying my admiration to others. On a more mundane note, I've been dealing with a cold, and Hannah has been kind enough to keep me company. As we sat on the couch, sniffling and sipping tea, I realized that I need to focus on more pressing matters - like applying to freshman seminars. It's time to look beyond the confines of my room and engage with the world outside, where I can explore my interests and passions without the need for justification. Despite the criticisms, my poster of Einstein remains, a reminder of the importance of staying true to oneself, even in the face of adversity.",

Einstein had invented the atomic bomb, mistreated dogs, neglected his children. \u201cThere were many greater geniuses than Einstein,\u201d a guy from down the hall, who had stopped by to borrow my copy of Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u201cThe Double,\u201d said. \u201cAlfred Nobel hated mathematics and didn\u2019t give the Nobel Prize to any mathematicians. There were many who were more deserving.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d I handed him the book. \u201cWell, see you around.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d he said, glaring at the poster. \u201cThis is the man who beats his wife, forces her to solve his mathematical problems, and then denies her credit. And you put his picture on your wall.\u201d \u201cListen, leave me out of this,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my poster. It\u2019s a complicated situation.\u201d He wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cEinstein is synonymous with genius in this country, while many greater geniuses aren\u2019t famous at all. Why is this? I am asking you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s really the best, and even jealous mudslingers can\u2019t hide his star quality,\u201d I said. \u201cNietzsche would say that such a great genius is entitled to beat his wife.\u201d That shut him up. After he left, I thought about taking down the poster. I wanted to be a courageous person, uncowed by other people\u2019s dumb opinions. But which was the dumb opinion, thinking Einstein was so great or thinking he was the worst? Hannah and I both caught a terrible cold. We took turns buying cold medicine and knocked it back from the little plastic cup as if we were doing shots. When it came time to choose classes, everyone said it was of utmost importance to apply to freshman seminars, because otherwise it could be years before you had a chance to work with senior faculty.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I sit in my room, surrounded by the familiar comforts of my daily life, I've come to realize that it's not just a personal sanctuary, but also a hub for interactions with others who often challenge my perspectives. My admiration for Albert Einstein, for instance, has been a subject of scrutiny for many who visit me. It's as if they feel compelled to disillusion me with negative opinions and so-called \"facts\" about his life and character. I recall a particular encounter with a guy from down the hall who borrowed a book from me, only to criticize the poster of Einstein hanging on my wall. He accused Einstein of being a bad husband and a plagiarist, among other things. I listened patiently, though with a hint of sarcasm, as I defended my admiration for the brilliant physicist. \"So, you're saying I should only admire people who are perfect?\" I asked, trying to hide my frustration. After he left, I couldn't help but wonder if I should take down the poster, not because I believed the criticisms, but because I was tired of justifying my admiration to others. On a more mundane note, I've been dealing with a cold, and Hannah has been kind enough to keep me company. As we sat on the couch, sniffling and sipping tea, I realized that I need to focus on more pressing matters - like applying to freshman seminars. It's time to look beyond the confines of my room and engage with the world outside, where I can explore my interests and passions without the need for justification. Despite the criticisms, my poster of Einstein remains, a reminder of the importance of staying true to oneself, even in the face of adversity.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

My assumptions were confirmed later in the evening when he introduced himself as a gas engineer. Despite the differences in their lives and personalities, there was a shared authenticity in how they presented themselves. In a spontaneous moment of boldness, something quite uncharacteristic of me, I decided to break the ice and initiate a conversation. It was a risky move, one I had never dared to make before, but something about the familiarity of his presence compelled me to take that leap. Our conversation was a delightful revelation, filled with unexpected depth and warmth, bridging the gap between his technical world and the literary realm that Patrick inhabited. As we exchanged stories and laughter, I realized this encounter was not merely a coincidence but a serendipitous opportunity to reflect on the past and embrace the present.",

As I continued to observe him, I couldn't help but compare the two: Patrick, who I remember as an academic deeply immersed in the world of Early Modern literature, and this man, whose hands and posture suggested a life of physical labor. My assumptions were confirmed later in the evening when he introduced himself as a gas engineer. Despite the differences in their lives and personalities, there was a shared authenticity in how they presented themselves. In a spontaneous moment of boldness, something quite uncharacteristic of me, I decided to break the ice and initiate a conversation. It was a risky move, one I had never dared to make before, but something about the familiarity of his presence compelled me to take that leap. Our conversation was a delightful revelation, filled with unexpected depth and warmth, bridging the gap between his technical world and the literary realm that Patrick inhabited. As we exchanged stories and laughter, I realized this encounter was not merely a coincidence but a serendipitous opportunity to reflect on the past and embrace the present.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

I recall one particularly sleepless night, when her soft humming of a song about a \"greasy old duck\" sent my imagination into overdrive, conjuring up visions of a monstrous creature that haunted my every waking moment. Her boasts about the old duck's prowess as a hunter only served to heighten my anxiety, as she drew unflattering comparisons between its skills and my own perceived inadequacies. In a bid to elicit some sympathy, I suggested that I might starve, but she simply laughed and returned with a collection of bird bones, which she intended to use to adorn her dress. I offered to help her dye the bones, hoping to find some common ground, but she rebuffed me, implying that my involvement might somehow interfere with the dress's healing properties. Her rejection cut deep, and I found myself professing my love, only to be met with a cruel retort that left me feeling raw and vulnerable. Undeterred, she continued to work on her dress, a stunning creation made from moose hide and adorned with the dyed bird bones, which seemed to radiate a soft, natural beauty. Despite my admiration, she warned me not to touch, suggesting that her beauty was somehow dangerous, a warning that only served to heighten my desire. I couldn't help but hope that the dress might somehow bring us closer together, but she revealed that she was dizzy from wine given to her by an old man, a revelation that only served to further distance herself from me. As I watched her, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing, a sense of being forever out of reach.",

I said so. \u201cDon\u2019t touch\u201d was all she said. \u201cMy roses have pickers so long they could pierce your heart and kill you.\u201d I crept close to her, thinking that maybe the medicine dress would do its healing work and bring us together, but the opposite happened. \u201cMy, my.\u201d She clucked her tongue, her eyes sparkling with malicious fire. \u201cI\u2019m dizzy. That old man down the road gave me a sip of wine!\u201d\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I reflect on my interactions with this enigmatic woman, I am struck by the push-and-pull of our relationship, a delicate dance of fascination and frustration that has left me reeling. I recall one particularly sleepless night, when her soft humming of a song about a \"greasy old duck\" sent my imagination into overdrive, conjuring up visions of a monstrous creature that haunted my every waking moment. Her boasts about the old duck's prowess as a hunter only served to heighten my anxiety, as she drew unflattering comparisons between its skills and my own perceived inadequacies. In a bid to elicit some sympathy, I suggested that I might starve, but she simply laughed and returned with a collection of bird bones, which she intended to use to adorn her dress. I offered to help her dye the bones, hoping to find some common ground, but she rebuffed me, implying that my involvement might somehow interfere with the dress's healing properties. Her rejection cut deep, and I found myself professing my love, only to be met with a cruel retort that left me feeling raw and vulnerable. Undeterred, she continued to work on her dress, a stunning creation made from moose hide and adorned with the dyed bird bones, which seemed to radiate a soft, natural beauty. Despite my admiration, she warned me not to touch, suggesting that her beauty was somehow dangerous, a warning that only served to heighten my desire. I couldn't help but hope that the dress might somehow bring us closer together, but she revealed that she was dizzy from wine given to her by an old man, a revelation that only served to further distance herself from me. As I watched her, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing, a sense of being forever out of reach.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

But Annie had wept when he told her, and then said angrily, through her tears, that there was a baby coming, knowing even as she said it that to break the news to him in this way was to condemn the child to a life of trouble. He took the tea towels she had left to dry by the sink, wound them into ropes, and placed them along the windowsill. He carried the length of rubber tubing through the living room and into the bedroom. He slipped off his shoes and put the tube to his mouth as if to pull smoke. He had seen this in a picture book somewhere: a fat sultan on a red pillow, doing much the same. He sat on the edge of the bed. He bowed his head and prayed: now and at the hour of our death. He lay back on the bed. He noticed that the room had grown dimmer still. Hour of our. Our hour. He remembered his mother, the picture book spread out on her wide lap. Within this very hour he would put his head on her shoulder once again. Or would he? Would this effort to prove himself his own man\u2014to prove that the hours of his life belonged to himself alone\u2014bar him from Heaven? Did he believe in Heaven?

This desert was not just a landscape but a revelation, the sand whispering secrets of the transition from life to death.

I recall one particularly sleepless night, when her soft humming of a song about a \"greasy old duck\" sent my imagination into overdrive, conjuring up visions of a monstrous creature that haunted my every waking moment. Her boasts about the old duck's prowess as a hunter only served to heighten my anxiety, as she drew unflattering comparisons between its skills and my own perceived inadequacies. In a bid to elicit some sympathy, I suggested that I might starve, but she simply laughed and returned with a collection of bird bones, which she intended to use to adorn her dress. I offered to help her dye the bones, hoping to find some common ground, but she rebuffed me, implying that my involvement might somehow interfere with the dress's healing properties. Her rejection cut deep, and I found myself professing my love, only to be met with a cruel retort that left me feeling raw and vulnerable. Undeterred, she continued to work on her dress, a stunning creation made from moose hide and adorned with the dyed bird bones, which seemed to radiate a soft, natural beauty. Despite my admiration, she warned me not to touch, suggesting that her beauty was somehow dangerous, a warning that only served to heighten my desire. I couldn't help but hope that the dress might somehow bring us closer together, but she revealed that she was dizzy from wine given to her by an old man, a revelation that only served to further distance herself from me.

I recall one particularly sleepless night, when her soft humming of a song about a \"greasy old duck\" sent my imagination into overdrive, conjuring up visions of a monstrous creature that haunted my every waking moment. Her boasts about the old duck's prowess as a hunter only served to heighten my anxiety, as she drew unflattering comparisons between its skills and my own perceived inadequacies. In a bid to elicit some sympathy, I suggested that I might starve, but she simply laughed and returned with a collection of bird bones, which she intended to use to adorn her dress. I offered to help her dye the bones, hoping to find some common ground, but she rebuffed me, implying that my involvement might somehow interfere with the dress's healing properties. Her rejection cut deep, and I found myself professing my love, only to be met with a cruel retort that left me feeling raw and vulnerable. Undeterred, she continued to work on her dress, a stunning creation made from moose hide and adorned with the dyed bird bones, which seemed to radiate a soft, natural beauty. Despite my admiration, she warned me not to touch, suggesting that her beauty was somehow dangerous, a warning that only served to heighten my desire. I couldn't help but hope that the dress might somehow bring us closer together, but she revealed that she was dizzy from wine given to her by an old man, a revelation that only served to further distance herself from me. As I watched her, I couldn't help but feel a sense of longing, a sense of being forever out of reach.\n\nParagraph 2:\nOne night, she hummed in an irritating manner, under her breath. \u201cNiinimoshenh,\u201d she finally let me hear her singing, \u201csweetheart, little duck, speak softly, for my old man will hear you creeping underneath my blanket.\u201d Of course, after that I tossed all night, at each little noise, imagining the greasy old duck sneaking into our cabin.

    "paragraph1": "A couple weeks later, Rafa disappeared. Took the Monarch and vanished. No note or telephone call, nada. Gone for one day, gone for two. By then Mami was starting to flip seriously out. Had the Four Horsefaces putting out an A.P.B. on the godline. Walked around the neighborhood asking everybody if they\u2019d seen my brother, even the gringos, and my mother had to be under serious duress to speak to a gringo. I was starting to worry, too, remembering that when he was first diagnosed he\u2019d jumped into his ride and tried to drive to Miami, where he had some boy or another. He hadn\u2019t made it past Philly before his car broke down. I wondered if he was on his way to Cali or something. He\u2019d always wanted to see L.A. One of his dreams. I got worried enough that I walked over to Tammy Franco\u2019s house, but when her Polack husband answered the door I lost my nerve. I turned around and walked away. On the third night we were in the apartment just waiting when the Monarch pulled up. My mother ran over to the porch. Holding the curtains until her knuckles were white. No, she said finally. Rafa stomped in with Pura in tow. He was clearly drunk, and Pura was dressed as if they\u2019d just been at a club. Where have you been? Mami said. Check it out, Rafa said, holding out both his and Pura\u2019s hands. They had rings on. We got married! It\u2019s totally official, Pura said giddily, pulling the license from her purse. You should have seen the expression on my mother\u2019s face. It was worse than when my father ran off with his putika. Worse than when the doctor had first said the word \u201cleukemia.\u201d Her face drained of everything. Is she pregnant? Not yet, Pura said. Is she pregnant? My mother looked straight at my brother. No, Rafa said. I\u2019m going to be moving in, cu\u00f1ada. Pura went to hug my mother. Let\u2019s have a drink, my brother said. My mother stopped Pura with an upraised finger. No one is drinking in my house. I\u2019m having a drink. My brother walked toward the kitchen but my mother stiff-armed him. Ma, Rafa said. No one is drinking in this house. She pushed Rafa back. If this\u2014she threw her hand in Pura\u2019s direction\u2014is how you want to spend what might be the last months of your life, then, Rafael Urbano, I have nothing more to say to you. Please, I would like you and your puta to leave my house. My brother\u2019s eyes went flat. I ain\u2019t going anywhere. I want you\u2014and this is when she started shrieking\u2014out of here! For a second I thought my brother, who had punched every fucking thing that had ever crossed him\u2014boys, girls, men, women, viejos, white boys, morenos, Boricuas, Filipinos, chinos, teachers, policemen\u2014but had never in his life put his hand on my mother, was going to pop her. I really did. And for an instant I think he considered it. But then all the swolt went out of him. He put his arm around Pura (who, for once, looked as if she understood that something was wrong). I\u2019ll see you later, Ma, he said. Then he got back into the Monarch and drove away.",
    "paragraph2": "The tension in our house reached its breaking point when Rafa finally returned after three days of complete silence, during which Mami had barely slept, constantly pacing between the window and the phone. When he walked through the door with Pura by his side, something in Mami's eyes changed \u2013 a mixture of relief instantly morphing into confusion, then anger. \"We got married,\" Rafa announced, his voice carrying a defiant pride that made my stomach twist. Mami's face drained of color as she processed the news, her hands gripping the kitchen counter so hard her knuckles turned white. I stood in the corner, watching the scene unfold like a witness to an inevitable crash. \"\u00bfEst\u00e1s loco?\" Mami's voice trembled, barely above a whisper at first, then rising like a storm. \"How could you do this? With your condition? Without telling me?\" Rafa's health had always been a source of worry for all of us, but he hated being reminded of it, and I could see his jaw tightening at Mami's words. Pura stood slightly behind him, her face a mask of discomfort and determination. The argument escalated quickly, with Mami's words becoming sharper, more cutting, as she demanded they leave her house immediately. \"You want to play husband? Then go be a man and provide for your wife somewhere else!\" she shouted, her accent thickening with emotion. Rafa started to argue back, his voice matching her intensity, but there was a hint of desperation in it that I hadn't heard before. I wanted to intervene, to say something that would make everything okay, but the words stuck in my throat. The air in the room felt thick with unspoken feelings and years of complicated history. Finally, after what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes, Rafa grabbed Pura's hand and headed for the door. He paused briefly, looking back at Mami with a mixture of hurt and anger that made him seem both older and younger than his years. \"V\u00e1monos,\" he said to Pura, his voice now eerily calm. As they left, Mami turned away, her shoulders shaking slightly, but she didn't make a sound. I stood there, torn between following my brother and comforting my mother, feeling the weight of family loyalty pulling me in opposite directions. The sound of the front door closing echoed through the house like a gunshot, marking the moment our family dynamic changed forever. The silence that followed was deafening, filled with all the things we should have said differently, all the ways we could have handled it better, and all the love that somehow got lost in translation between generations and expectations.",

Took the Monarch and vanished. No note or telephone call, nada. Gone for one day, gone for two. By then Mami was starting to flip seriously out. Had the Four Horsefaces putting out an A.P.B. on the godline. Walked around the neighborhood asking everybody if they\u2019d seen my brother, even the gringos, and my mother had to be under serious duress to speak to a gringo. I was starting to worry, too, remembering that when he was first diagnosed he\u2019d jumped into his ride and tried to drive to Miami, where he had some boy or another. He hadn\u2019t made it past Philly before his car broke down. I wondered if he was on his way to Cali or something. He\u2019d always wanted to see L.A. One of his dreams. I got worried enough that I walked over to Tammy Franco\u2019s house, but when her Polack husband answered the door I lost my nerve. I turned around and walked away. On the third night we were in the apartment just waiting when the Monarch pulled up. My mother ran over to the porch. Holding the curtains until her knuckles were white. No, she said finally. Rafa stomped in with Pura in tow. He was clearly drunk, and Pura was dressed as if they\u2019d just been at a club. Where have you been? Mami said. Check it out, Rafa said, holding out both his and Pura\u2019s hands. They had rings on. We got married! It\u2019s totally official, Pura said giddily, pulling the license from her purse. You should have seen the expression on my mother\u2019s face. It was worse than when my father ran off with his putika. Worse than when the doctor had first said the word \u201cleukemia.\u201d Her face drained of everything. Is she pregnant? Not yet, Pura said. Is she pregnant? My mother looked straight at my brother. No, Rafa said. I\u2019m going to be moving in, cu\u00f1ada. Pura went to hug my mother. Let\u2019s have a drink, my brother said. My mother stopped Pura with an upraised finger. No one is drinking in my house. I\u2019m having a drink. My brother walked toward the kitchen but my mother stiff-armed him. Ma, Rafa said. No one is drinking in this house. She pushed Rafa back. If this\u2014she threw her hand in Pura\u2019s direction\u2014is how you want to spend what might be the last months of your life, then, Rafael Urbano, I have nothing more to say to you. Please, I would like you and your puta to leave my house. My brother\u2019s eyes went flat. I ain\u2019t going anywhere. I want you\u2014and this is when she started shrieking\u2014out of here! For a second I thought my brother, who had punched every fucking thing that had ever crossed him\u2014boys, girls, men, women, viejos, white boys, morenos, Boricuas, Filipinos, chinos, teachers, policemen\u2014but had never in his life put his hand on my mother, was going to pop her. I really did. And for an instant I think he considered it. But then all the swolt went out of him. He put his arm around Pura (who, for once, looked as if she understood that something was wrong). I\u2019ll see you later, Ma, he said. Then he got back into the Monarch and drove away.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe tension in our house reached its breaking point when Rafa finally returned after three days of complete silence, during which Mami had barely slept, constantly pacing between the window and the phone. When he walked through the door with Pura by his side, something in Mami's eyes changed \u2013 a mixture of relief instantly morphing into confusion, then anger. \"We got married,\" Rafa announced, his voice carrying a defiant pride that made my stomach twist. Mami's face drained of color as she processed the news, her hands gripping the kitchen counter so hard her knuckles turned white. I stood in the corner, watching the scene unfold like a witness to an inevitable crash. \"\u00bfEst\u00e1s loco?\" Mami's voice trembled, barely above a whisper at first, then rising like a storm. \"How could you do this? With your condition? Without telling me?\" Rafa's health had always been a source of worry for all of us, but he hated being reminded of it, and I could see his jaw tightening at Mami's words. Pura stood slightly behind him, her face a mask of discomfort and determination. The argument escalated quickly, with Mami's words becoming sharper, more cutting, as she demanded they leave her house immediately. \"You want to play husband? Then go be a man and provide for your wife somewhere else!\" she shouted, her accent thickening with emotion. Rafa started to argue back, his voice matching her intensity, but there was a hint of desperation in it that I hadn't heard before. I wanted to intervene, to say something that would make everything okay, but the words stuck in my throat. The air in the room felt thick with unspoken feelings and years of complicated history. Finally, after what seemed like hours but was probably only minutes, Rafa grabbed Pura's hand and headed for the door. He paused briefly, looking back at Mami with a mixture of hurt and anger that made him seem both older and younger than his years. \"V\u00e1monos,\" he said to Pura, his voice now eerily calm. As they left, Mami turned away, her shoulders shaking slightly, but she didn't make a sound. I stood there, torn between following my brother and comforting my mother, feeling the weight of family loyalty pulling me in opposite directions. The sound of the front door closing echoed through the house like a gunshot, marking the moment our family dynamic changed forever. The silence that followed was deafening, filled with all the things we should have said differently, all the ways we could have handled it better, and all the love that somehow got lost in translation between generations and expectations.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

She announced more money in the next few years, especially for teachers, defense and local authorities. But starting in 2026, day-to-day spending for government departments would grow on average 1.3 percent annually, after accounting for inflation, which analysts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies said would still leave some departments with very tight budgets. At the same time, Ms. Reeves also set to increase public investment. She said that over the next five years, the government would increase capital spending by \u00a3100 billion to invest in projects, such as school buildings, hospital beds and diagnostics centers. In all, Ms. Reeves\u2019s measures will temporarily aid the economy but leave its size \u201clargely unchanged\u201d in five years, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. It forecast slightly higher growth for this year and next, but said growth would then slow to below 2 percent a year. However, a sustained increase in public investment would raise the supply potential of the economy, which could increase long-term growth, the budget responsibility office said.",
    "paragraph2": "Ms. Reeves demonstrated a measured approach to fiscal policy while facing mounting pressure to boost Britain's public service funding. Her announcement outlined increased funding allocations over the coming years, with specific focus on teachers, defense, and local authorities, though she maintained strict control by capping day-to-day departmental spending growth at 1.3 percent annually from 2026, accounting for inflation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies' analysis suggested this conservative approach would create challenging financial constraints for certain departments. A notable aspect of her strategy included a substantial \u00a3100 billion increase in public investment over five years, targeting critical infrastructure such as school buildings and hospitals. The Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment indicated that while these measures would provide temporary economic support, they would not substantially alter the economy's size within five years, as growth was projected to decelerate below 2 percent annually. Nevertheless, they acknowledged that the increased public investment could potentially enhance the economy's capacity for long-term growth.",

But starting in 2026, day-to-day spending for government departments would grow on average 1.3 percent annually, after accounting for inflation, which analysts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies said would still leave some departments with very tight budgets. At the same time, Ms. Reeves also set to increase public investment. She said that over the next five years, the government would increase capital spending by \u00a3100 billion to invest in projects, such as school buildings, hospital beds and diagnostics centers. In all, Ms. Reeves\u2019s measures will temporarily aid the economy but leave its size \u201clargely unchanged\u201d in five years, the Office for Budget Responsibility said. It forecast slightly higher growth for this year and next, but said growth would then slow to below 2 percent a year. However, a sustained increase in public investment would raise the supply potential of the economy, which could increase long-term growth, the budget responsibility office said.\n\nParagraph 2:\nMs. Reeves demonstrated a measured approach to fiscal policy while facing mounting pressure to boost Britain's public service funding. Her announcement outlined increased funding allocations over the coming years, with specific focus on teachers, defense, and local authorities, though she maintained strict control by capping day-to-day departmental spending growth at 1.3 percent annually from 2026, accounting for inflation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies' analysis suggested this conservative approach would create challenging financial constraints for certain departments. A notable aspect of her strategy included a substantial \u00a3100 billion increase in public investment over five years, targeting critical infrastructure such as school buildings and hospitals. The Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment indicated that while these measures would provide temporary economic support, they would not substantially alter the economy's size within five years, as growth was projected to decelerate below 2 percent annually. Nevertheless, they acknowledged that the increased public investment could potentially enhance the economy's capacity for long-term growth.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Sitting at his desk was a test of endurance, and the daily commute on the train was an exercise in agony. Despite his obvious discomfort, Mel was stubbornly resistant to seeking help, even when his wife Barbara suggested that he consult with Rabbi Zylberfenig, a man she believed offered wise counsel. As the week drew to a close, the tension between Mel and Barbara came to a head over dinner, the table set with the traditional Jewish foods and symbols that were a staple of their Friday evenings.

    "paragraph1": "In the quiet solitude of his room, Samsa lay nestled within the comforting embrace of a large, cozy bed, the kind that seems to cradle one in dreams, with soft layers that could almost lull a person back to sleep even in the midst of wakefulness. The air was still, and the early morning light filtered gently through the curtains, casting a serene glow over the simple furnishings. Dressed in a dark blue dressing gown and matching slippers, Samsa found solace in the uncomplicated attire, a choice that offered ease and familiarity amidst the complexities of daily life. The simple fabric felt smooth against his skin, a welcome alternative to the often cumbersome and intricate clothing he typically avoided. Yet, the tranquility of the morning was abruptly shattered by the persistent ringing of the doorbell, a sound that cut through the silence with unyielding insistence. It was this noise, echoing persistently through the house, that roused Samsa from his drowsy state, urging him to rise from the comfort of his bed. With a sigh, he reached for his walking stick, a steadfast companion that not only provided physical support but a sense of security as he navigated the challenges of mobility. Carefully, he maneuvered himself out of bed, each movement deliberate and measured to avoid the danger of falling, a constant concern in his daily routine. The journey to the door was not a swift one, but Samsa approached it with patience, descending the stairs with cautious steps, the tap of his walking stick marking his progress. Upon reaching the door, he paused briefly, steadying himself before turning the handle and opening it to reveal the world beyond. There, on the doorstep, stood a young woman, her presence both unexpected and intriguing. Her posture was stooped, a subtle curvature that lent her an appearance of smallness despite the average proportions of her frame. Her hair, a rich chestnut hue, caught the light in a way that accentuated its natural warmth, cascading around her shoulders in gentle waves. She wore a tweed jacket, its texture adding an air of sophistication to her ensemble, paired with a loose skirt that moved softly with the breeze. The combination of her attire and demeanor presented a curious blend of youthful vibrancy and mature wisdom. Her eyes, however, held a skeptical expression, a look that suggested she approached the world with a questioning gaze, probing beneath the surface of things. It was a look that could both challenge and engage, demanding attention and reflection. As Samsa stood before her, he took in these details, each one painting a vivid picture of the visitor who had interrupted his morning. Her presence hinted at stories untold, mysteries wrapped in the everyday fabric of life, and as they exchanged greetings, Samsa was drawn into the subtle complexities of their encounter, his curiosity piqued by the unexpected blend of characteristics she embodied. In that moment, the ordinary act of answering the door became a doorway to possibilities, a reminder of the rich tapestry of human interaction and the unpredictable nature of the world outside his door.",
    "paragraph2": "Samsa found a dressing gown his size in the closet of the largest room. It looked like something he might be able to manage. He hadn\u2019t a clue what to do with the other clothes\u2014how to put them on, how to wear them. They were just too complicated: too many buttons, for one thing, and he was unsure how to tell front from back, or top from bottom. Which was supposed to go on the outside, and which underneath? The dressing gown, on the other hand, was simple, practical, and quite free of ornament. Its light, soft cloth felt good against his skin, and its color was dark blue. He even turned up a matching pair of slippers. He pulled the dressing gown over his naked body and, after much trial and error, succeeded in fastening the belt around his waist. He looked at himself in the mirror, clad now in gown and slippers. This was certainly better than walking around naked. It wasn\u2019t as warm as it might have been, to be sure, but as long as he remained indoors it would stave off the cold. Best of all, he no longer had to worry that his soft skin would be exposed to vicious birds. When the doorbell rang, Samsa was dozing in the biggest room (and in the biggest bed) in the house. It was warm under the feather quilts, as cozy as if he were sleeping in an egg. He woke from a dream. He couldn\u2019t remember it in detail, but it had been pleasant and cheerful. The bell echoing through the house, however, yanked him back to cold reality. He dragged himself from the bed, fastened his gown, put on his dark-blue slippers, grabbed his black walking stick, and, hand on railing, tottered down the stairs. It was far easier than it had been on the first occasion. Still, the danger of falling was ever present. He could not afford to let down his guard. Keeping a close eye on his feet, he picked his way down the stairs one step at a time, as the doorbell continued to ring. Whoever was pushing the buzzer had to be a most impatient and stubborn person. Walking stick in his left hand, Samsa approached the front door. He twisted the knob to the right and pulled, and the door swung in. A little woman was standing outside. A very little woman. It was a wonder she was able to reach the buzzer. When he looked more closely, however, he realized that the issue wasn\u2019t her size. It was her back, which was bent forward in a perpetual stoop. This made her appear small, though, in fact, her frame was of normal dimensions. She had fastened her hair with a rubber band to prevent it from spilling over her face. The hair was a deep chestnut and very abundant. She was dressed in a battered tweed jacket and a full, loose-fitting skirt that covered her ankles. A striped cotton scarf was wrapped around her neck. She wore no hat. Her shoes were of the tall lace-up variety, and she appeared to be in her early twenties. There was still something of the girl about her. Her eyes were big, her nose small, and her lips twisted a little to one side, like a skinny moon. Her dark eyebrows formed two straight lines across her forehead, giving her a skeptical look.",

Her hair, a rich chestnut hue, caught the light in a way that accentuated its natural warmth, cascading around her shoulders in gentle waves. She wore a tweed jacket, its texture adding an air of sophistication to her ensemble, paired with a loose skirt that moved softly with the breeze. The combination of her attire and demeanor presented a curious blend of youthful vibrancy and mature wisdom. Her eyes, however, held a skeptical expression, a look that suggested she approached the world with a questioning gaze, probing beneath the surface of things. It was a look that could both challenge and engage, demanding attention and reflection. As Samsa stood before her, he took in these details, each one painting a vivid picture of the visitor who had interrupted his morning. Her presence hinted at stories untold, mysteries wrapped in the everyday fabric of life, and as they exchanged greetings, Samsa was drawn into the subtle complexities of their encounter, his curiosity piqued by the unexpected blend of characteristics she embodied. In that moment, the ordinary act of answering the door became a doorway to possibilities, a reminder of the rich tapestry of human interaction and the unpredictable nature of the world outside his door.\n\nParagraph 2:\nSamsa found a dressing gown his size in the closet of the largest room. It looked like something he might be able to manage. He hadn\u2019t a clue what to do with the other clothes\u2014how to put them on, how to wear them. They were just too complicated: too many buttons, for one thing, and he was unsure how to tell front from back, or top from bottom. Which was supposed to go on the outside, and which underneath? The dressing gown, on the other hand, was simple, practical, and quite free of ornament. Its light, soft cloth felt good against his skin, and its color was dark blue. He even turned up a matching pair of slippers. He pulled the dressing gown over his naked body and, after much trial and error, succeeded in fastening the belt around his waist. He looked at himself in the mirror, clad now in gown and slippers. This was certainly better than walking around naked. It wasn\u2019t as warm as it might have been, to be sure, but as long as he remained indoors it would stave off the cold. Best of all, he no longer had to worry that his soft skin would be exposed to vicious birds. When the doorbell rang, Samsa was dozing in the biggest room (and in the biggest bed) in the house. It was warm under the feather quilts, as cozy as if he were sleeping in an egg. He woke from a dream. He couldn\u2019t remember it in detail, but it had been pleasant and cheerful. The bell echoing through the house, however, yanked him back to cold reality. He dragged himself from the bed, fastened his gown, put on his dark-blue slippers, grabbed his black walking stick, and, hand on railing, tottered down the stairs. It was far easier than it had been on the first occasion. Still, the danger of falling was ever present. He could not afford to let down his guard. Keeping a close eye on his feet, he picked his way down the stairs one step at a time, as the doorbell continued to ring. Whoever was pushing the buzzer had to be a most impatient and stubborn person. Walking stick in his left hand, Samsa approached the front door. He twisted the knob to the right and pulled, and the door swung in. A little woman was standing outside. A very little woman. It was a wonder she was able to reach the buzzer. When he looked more closely, however, he realized that the issue wasn\u2019t her size. It was her back, which was bent forward in a perpetual stoop. This made her appear small, though, in fact, her frame was of normal dimensions. She had fastened her hair with a rubber band to prevent it from spilling over her face. The hair was a deep chestnut and very abundant. She was dressed in a battered tweed jacket and a full, loose-fitting skirt that covered her ankles. A striped cotton scarf was wrapped around her neck. She wore no hat. Her shoes were of the tall lace-up variety, and she appeared to be in her early twenties. There was still something of the girl about her. Her eyes were big, her nose small, and her lips twisted a little to one side, like a skinny moon. Her dark eyebrows formed two straight lines across her forehead, giving her a skeptical look.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "I often find myself lost in thoughts about my family's history, a rich tapestry interwoven with stories and symbols that have shaped who I am today. One particular memory stands out vividly\u2014receiving a small, unassuming paperweight as a child. At first glance, it seemed like a simple object, but for me, it represented much more. It was a metaphor for the complex and intricate history of my family, a history that I have spent countless hours contemplating. I often liken our family history to grapes, each grape representing a story, a life, a moment in time that has contributed to the vast vineyard of our shared past. This metaphorical vineyard is both beautiful and burdensome, as it carries the weight of generations of love, struggle, and resilience. Nowadays, my reflections on family history are often intertwined with my anxieties about my child, Astra. I find myself consumed by an obsessive fear that Astra might choke on food\u2014a fear that has taken root deep within me and grown into a pervasive worry that I cannot seem to shake. This fear has become a point of tension between my partner, Inma, and me, as well as with Inma's mother, who frequently sides with Inma in our disagreements. Inma and I have different approaches to parenting, and my anxiety over Astra choking often leads to arguments that seem to encompass broader issues of power and love within our relationship. Inma believes that I am overly cautious and that my fears are unfounded, while I feel that my concerns are valid and that I am simply trying to protect our child. This conflict is further complicated by the involvement of Inma's mother, whose opinions often add fuel to the fire. She seems to view my concerns as an overreaction, aligning herself with Inma's more relaxed approach. In these moments, I feel isolated and misunderstood, my fears dismissed as irrational. However, my anxiety is very real to me, and it manifests in various ways, from meticulously cutting Astra's food into tiny, manageable pieces to constantly watching for any signs of distress while she eats. It's as though my fear of choking has become a focal point of my life, a lens through which I view my role as a parent and protector. This fear has caused me to question my abilities and has led to moments of self-doubt and insecurity. Despite the tension it creates, I cannot simply ignore what feels like an ever-present danger. Then, one day, I found myself in a situation that forced me to confront my own fears in a very personal way. I was enjoying a meal when, suddenly, I began to choke. In those terrifying moments, I realized how fragile life truly is and how easily the unexpected can occur. As I struggled to breathe, it dawned on me that my fear of Astra choking was not just about the act itself but about the vulnerability and lack of control that it represented. This incident served as a catalyst for introspection and self-awareness, prompting me to reconsider the dynamics at play in my relationship with Inma. I began to see that our differing beliefs about voicing fears were at the heart of many of our conflicts. Inma tends to approach life with a sense of optimism and trust, believing that voicing fears gives them power and life. In contrast, I have always felt that expressing my fears is a way to confront and manage them, to prepare for the worst so that I am not caught off guard. Our opposing viewpoints have led to misunderstandings and arguments, each of us convinced that our way is the right way. Through this experience, I realized that perhaps there is no right or wrong way, but rather a need for balance and understanding. I understood that my fear, while valid, should not overshadow the joy and spontaneity of life. Similarly, Inma's optimism should be tempered with caution and preparedness. This newfound understanding has not magically resolved our differences, but it has opened the door to more open and empathetic communication. It has allowed me to express my fears in a way that invites dialogue rather than defensiveness, and it has encouraged Inma to acknowledge my concerns without dismissing them outright. As we continue to navigate the challenges of parenthood and partnership, I am learning to let go of the need for control and to embrace the unpredictability of life. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that I cannot protect Astra from every danger, just as I cannot rewrite the past or alter my family's history. Instead, I can strive to create a nurturing and supportive environment where Astra can grow and thrive, where fears can be voiced and addressed without judgment. This journey is ongoing, and there are still moments of tension and disagreement, but I am hopeful that, with time and patience, we can find a balance that allows us to move forward together, united in our love for Astra and our commitment to one another.",

When Inma\u2019s mom was sitting with Astra at the table, it was less that I watched over them than that my effort not to was palpable, and if Inma or her mom was cutting something for Astra I perceived a slight exaggeration in their gestures, a trace of performativity that said, See how tiny these pieces are? Do we have your permission to feed her? It was a clich\u00e9, this tension around the child\u2019s eating, the triangulation, etc., but I was finding small, mortally uncut grapes in the purple plastic snack container Inma\u2019s mom took with Astra to the park, and large grapes on the high chair that were cut in half but never lengthwise (anyway, they should be quartered), and then I\u2019d confront Inma about it, as if it were her fault, demanding she talk to her mom, and before we knew it we would be having a spectacular fight, scaling up from the grapes to questions of power, labor, value, the possibility of love, Astra crying when we yelled (or, worse, taking it all in silently, blinking her large brown eyes). We\u2019d had one such fight only a month or two before I choked. And it was only when I choked, while I was standing there choking at Caf\u00e9 Loup, that I fully realized (although not in these words) that our polarization around the grapes issued from our conflicting but, in fact, equally magical beliefs about the effects of my voicing, again and again, my fear of Astra choking. Inma would of course agree that the food should be cut up, but the intensity of my focus on this particular risk, the repetitive articulation of my concerns\u2014reading statistics off my phone (\u201cLast year alone, every child in America choked to death\u201d), showing with my thumb and index finger the tiny diameter of a child\u2019s windpipe\u2014was, in Inma\u2019s mind, courting disaster.

Their apparent disregard for the First Amendment, designed to protect religion from state interference, is deeply concerning. It seems they are advancing an agenda that aligns with the Christian nationalist movement, which erroneously claims that America was founded as a Christian nation. However, this perspective overlooks the pluralistic foundation of our country and the constitutional prohibition against imposing a single religion. Such actions are not only unconstitutional but also exclusionary and offensive, particularly in the Southern states where these laws have been enacted. They undermine the diverse fabric of our nation and threaten the freedom of religion that is supposed to be a cornerstone of American democracy, disregarding the rights of those who hold different beliefs.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Once you\u2019ve said your piece and listened to what she has to say in her defense, repeating the same arguments over and over would be the act of a bully. Citizens, let alone family members, shouldn\u2019t be eager to direct vitriol against people whose political views they don\u2019t share. If the rest of your family wants to go on doing that, you should tell them that they\u2019re being unkind and unhelpful. Partyism is a morally debased form of political discourse. A friend of mine who is active in progressive politics and served in the Biden administration has a mother who voted for Trump. The mother, who is Black, Southern and religiously devout, is a single-issue voter: She\u2019s fervently opposed to abortion. My friend deeply disagrees with her mother\u2019s position but finds it intelligible. They\u2019ve made their peace.\n\nParagraph 2:\nPolitical disagreements within families can strain relationships, making it crucial to maintain respectful dialogue rather than resorting to hostile exchanges. When family members repeatedly attack each other over political views, it crosses into bullying territory, creating deep wounds that can be difficult to heal. A notable example is the relationship between a former Biden administration official and her mother, whose story illustrates how complex family political dynamics can be navigated successfully. Despite being Black, Southern, and deeply religious, the mother voted for Trump primarily due to her strong anti-abortion stance. Her daughter, though actively involved in progressive politics, chose to understand rather than condemn her mother's position.

He might find it in his power, and in his heart, to bring fantasy-besotted old Quichotte face to face with his lady love. Quichotte, arriving in Manhattan at the end of a long journey\u2014his quest toward Miss Salma R. had led him through Tulsa, Oklahoma; Beautiful, Kansas; Cleveland, Ohio; Bunyan, Pennsylvania; Chaucer, New Jersey; and Huckleberry, New York\u2014felt like a snail coming out of its shell. Here was bustle and thrum, hustle and flow, everything he had spent the better part of his life recoiling from, concealing himself instead in the heart of the country, leading a small life among other small lives. Now he was back in the big room, at the high rollers\u2019 table, betting the farm on love. He found accommodation in the Blue Yorker hotel, which stood conveniently just a couple of blocks from the tunnel exit, a hundred and three dollars a night, including parking, excellent value, no I.D. demanded, no questions asked, cash money required in advance, and only when he entered his Oriental Delights-themed room did he understand that he was in one of the city\u2019s numerous no-tell motels, with six free porno channels on the TV. There was adjustable mood lighting. There were strategically placed mirrors. The night was full of noises, of pleasure, pain, and painful pleasure. It was hard to sleep soundly. But, in the days that followed, Quichotte was pensive and sad. He stayed in his room watching TV (not the porno channels). He did not go to stand outside Miss Salma R.\u2019s apartment building, or outside her office slash studio, in the hope of glimpsing the woman whose heart he had come to the city to win. \u201cThere is still much to be done before I am worthy of her presence,\u201d he told himself, and then, seemingly, did nothing. The path to the Beloved was closed, even when he was so near to her, and he did not know how to open it. Then, unexpectedly, he received a mysterious series of texts from his cousin and erstwhile employer, asking where he was, seeming unsurprised when he confirmed that he was in New York, and requesting an immediate meeting by an old red-oak tree near the Hans Christian Andersen statue in Central Park. He went to the Park and Dr. Smile was waiting for him. Hat, coat, small leather attach\u00e9 case, like an Old World medico doing his rounds. But there had been a transformation in his state of mind. He was no longer the warm and gleeful man Quichotte remembered. \u201cBest of cousins!\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s walk a little,\u201d Dr. Smile said. His mood, Quichotte noted with regret, was foul. \u201cThere has been an event today in Atlanta,\u201d Dr. Smile said as they walked in the general direction of the boathouse. \u201cA shocking event, may I say. An offensive event concerning my good wife.\u201d \u201cMrs. Happy?\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cThat is indeed unexpected and woeful news! I hope she has not met with a misfortune?\u201d \u201c \u2018Misfortune\u2019 is too mild a word,\u201d Dr. Smile said grimly. \u201cI will tell you what has happened. I have a need to tell someone, and I believe I can talk to you\u2014because, to put it bluntly, you are nobody, you know nobody, so you can tell nobody who is anybody, and, plus, you are borderline simple as well.\u201d This remark\u2014its tone very unlike the kind manner with which his cousin had always spoken to him\u2014struck Quichotte as harsh and, in part, incorrect. \u201cBut everybody is somebody,\u201d he replied mildly. \u201cAlthough the language can be confusing.

Look,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cThere, there, there. Somebody, somebody, somebody.\u201d He pointed at himself. \u201cSomebody,\u201d he concluded with pride. Dr. Smile heard him out with growing impatience. \u201cI repeat,\u201d he said, \u201cborderline simple. And I don\u2019t have time for small talk. I have something to say today about the injustice of the world toward a man who is only trying to do his best. And also toward his lady wife, an innocent bystander, Happy by name, happy by nature.

    "paragraph2": "As Dr. R. K. Smile sat in his opulent office, surrounded by the trappings of a life built on questionable ethics, he couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement at the prospect of a new opportunity. A tip had come his way, whispering of a chance to meet the famous actress, Miss Salma R., a woman whose beauty and talent had captivated the hearts of millions, including that of his poor relation, Quichotte. Dr. Smile's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he thought of the potential benefits this meeting could bring, not just for himself, but for Quichotte, who had been pining for the actress for what felt like an eternity. Quichotte, a man with a heart full of love and a soul full of determination, had traveled across the vast expanse of the United States, from the sun-kissed deserts of the west to the concrete jungle of New York, all in the hopes of catching a glimpse of his beloved Miss Salma R. Now, as he sat in his cramped, dingy hotel room, surrounded by the detritus of a life on the move, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unworthiness, a nagging doubt that he was somehow less than deserving of the actress's attention. It was a feeling that had become all too familiar for Quichotte, one that he had grown accustomed to, but never truly accepted. And so, when a mysterious message arrived from Dr. Smile, requesting a meeting in the heart of Central Park, Quichotte's curiosity was piqued. What could Dr. Smile want with him? What news could he possibly have to share? The questions swirled in Quichotte's mind like a maelstrom, pulling him in with an otherworldly force. As he made his way through the crowded streets of Manhattan, the towering skyscrapers looming above him like giants, Quichotte couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to change in ways he couldn't yet imagine. The meeting with Dr. Smile was a revelation, a glimpse into a world that Quichotte had only ever caught glimpses of. Dr. Smile, resplendent in his tailored suit and gleaming gold watch, seemed every inch the confident, self-assured man that Quichotte had always known him to be. But as they walked through the park, the sounds of the city fading into the background, Dr. Smile's mask began to slip, revealing a man troubled by the weight of his own making. He spoke of the recent raid on his wife's social gathering, the accusations of corruption that had been leveled against him, and the frustration that had been building inside him like a powder keg. \"I've enriched so many people, Quichotte,\" Dr. Smile exclaimed, his voice rising in indignation. \"I've given them the keys to the kingdom, and this is how they repay me? By betraying me, by turning on me like a pack of wolves?\" Quichotte listened, entranced, as Dr. Smile defended his actions, dismissing the allegations of corruption as nothing more than a cultural norm. \"This is how business is done, Quichotte,\" he said, his eyes glinting with a mixture of defiance and desperation. \"This is how the game is played. And I've played it better than most.\" Despite his bravado, however, Dr. Smile was clearly a man on the ropes, his confidence shaken by the recent turn of events. And yet, even as he spoke of his troubles, there was a hint of something else, a sense that he was holding something back, something",

Its free 24/7 helpline responded to 215,000 contacts in the 2023 fiscal year, and its online community called ALZConnected has about 10,000 active members. It conducts more than 27,000 caregiver support groups nationally.\n\nParagraph 2:\nJustin McBride, a senior administrator at Duet: Partners in Health and Aging, has witnessed firsthand the transformative power of mentoring programs in supporting individuals facing health challenges. \"The impact is profound on both sides of the relationship,\" McBride notes, emphasizing how mentors often find as much meaning in the experience as their mentees. Since its inception in 2016, Duet's Phoenix-based program has implemented a rigorous screening and training process for mentors, ensuring quality support for those in need. Similar initiatives, such as Penn's Caring Collective, have adopted varying commitment lengths to accommodate different volunteer schedules while maintaining program effectiveness. These localized efforts complement the work of larger organizations like the Alzheimer's Association, which provides comprehensive support through helplines and support groups for dementia patients and their caregivers. The structured approach to mentoring, combined with the flexibility to meet diverse needs, has proven successful in creating sustainable support networks that benefit both volunteers and recipients of care.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

There were some that stretched themselves thin between nonsense and poetry (\u201cThe fireplace is not real\u201d).

They popped up in unexpected places, bearing messages that veered wildly from warm welcomes to curt directives and announcements that seemed to hold secrets just out of reach. As time passed, Szmura's prose gave way to verse, and Bogdan found himself collecting the scraps of paper with a growing sense of fascination. It was easy to imagine some future archaeologist stumbling upon the cache and interpreting it as the remnants of a lost civilization, a window into a world where the mundane and the surreal coexisted in a delicate balance.

Every morning, Bogdan would find on the kitchen table a note in a taut, wiry handwriting that corresponded somehow to the essence of Szmura: the letter \u201cT\u201d was like his body\u2014straight, slim, angular. The notes occasionally welcomed him again (\u201cFeel at home\u201d), but more often they were directives (\u201cWash the damn dishes\u201d) or announcements (\u201cRent due Tuesday\u201d). There were some that stretched themselves thin between nonsense and poetry (\u201cThe fireplace is not real\u201d). When Szmura, abruptly and inexplicably, started writing them down in verse form, Bogdan began collecting them. One day, from the desert covering the ruins of Chicago, a rusty box full of faded patches of paper will be excavated, and some good archeologist will discover the soul of a perished civilization in these abstruse verses: The door is either Open or locked I like Locked Or: Your socks are all over How many fucking feet do you have?

They popped up in unexpected places, bearing messages that veered wildly from warm welcomes to curt directives and announcements that seemed to hold secrets just out of reach. As time passed, Szmura's prose gave way to verse, and Bogdan found himself collecting the scraps of paper with a growing sense of fascination. It was easy to imagine some future archaeologist stumbling upon the cache and interpreting it as the remnants of a lost civilization, a window into a world where the mundane and the surreal coexisted in a delicate balance. Meanwhile, Bogdan often retreated to the confines of his room, feeling the weight of his isolation and searching for an escape from the stifling sense of confinement that seemed to seep from the very walls.

    "paragraph1": "I first learned about R\u00e9gine through a series of peculiar circumstances that revolved around Denis, whom everyone referred to as \"the good Denis,\" and this encounter would ultimately reveal a complex web of emotions and unspoken histories that I never could have anticipated. The story unfolded gradually, with R\u00e9gine eventually sharing the profound impact Denis had on her life, but what she revealed next shook me to my core \u2013 Denis had harbored an intense, almost sacred love for me when I was a child, so much so that it had prevented him from having children with her, a fact that had caused her immense pain and resentment over the years. As she recounted her story, I could feel the weight of her words, heavy with years of suppressed emotions and unfulfilled dreams, all somehow connected to my unknowing presence in Denis's life. Her revelation was both touching and disturbing, painting a picture of Denis as a man whose capacity for love had somehow become fixated on a child \u2013 me \u2013 to the detriment of his adult relationships, particularly his relationship with R\u00e9gine. The complexity of her feelings was evident in how she spoke about Denis, mixing reverence for his saintly nature with the bitter acknowledgment of how his devotion to me had ultimately led to her own unhappiness. When I expressed a desire to meet her in person, perhaps hoping to bridge this unexpected gap between us or offer some form of reconciliation, she firmly rejected the idea, making it clear that she preferred to forget both Denis and her resentment towards me as an adult. Her rejection forced me to confront my own role in this complicated narrative, though I had been merely a child and unaware of the impact my presence had on their lives. As I reflected on this situation, I became acutely aware of my own lack of goodness, particularly in comparison to Denis's apparent saintliness, and I made the conscious decision not to seek R\u00e9gine's forgiveness, understanding that some wounds are better left untouched. This experience left me with a peculiar resolution: if I ever were to encounter Denis again, I would keep my knowledge of R\u00e9gine and her story buried deep within me, maintaining the silence that she so desperately sought. The whole situation had revealed layers of human complexity I hadn't expected to encounter \u2013 how one person's pure love could inadvertently cause another's suffering, how childhood innocence could unknowingly cast long shadows into adult lives, and how the past continues to shape our present in ways we can never fully understand. The story of R\u00e9gine, Denis, and my unwitting role in their narrative became a testament to the intricate ways in which human lives intersect and affect one another, often without our knowledge or consent, and how some relationships, despite their significance, are better left in the realm of memory rather than pursued into the present. This realization came with a certain melancholy, an understanding that sometimes the kindest action is to respect the distances that others choose to maintain, even when those distances are born from pain and resentment that we didn't intentionally cause. The entire experience left me with a profound appreciation for the complexity of human relationships and the way that love, even in its purest form, can sometimes lead to unexpected consequences that ripple through time, affecting lives in ways we could never predict or fully comprehend. The situation with R\u00e9gine and Denis had become a lesson in the delicate balance between understanding and action, between the desire to make amends and the wisdom to know when to step back, and ultimately, about the complicated nature of human",
    "paragraph2": "And then, miraculously, I made the acquaintance of R\u00e9gine. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d \u201cBy chance and persistence, which is to say that the tenacity I devoted not to finding you, exactly, since I had no idea you existed, but to following the trail of the good Denis led me to you, by accident, by fortune.\u201d \u201cYes, Denis. Why do you call him the good Denis?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how people speak of him to me. Is it not true?\u201d \u201cOh, it is, it is. Oh, yes, yes. The too good Denis, if you see what I mean, the excessively good Denis, perhaps, but, yes, he was good, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d \u201cOh, I am, I am. His goodness was like a thunderbolt, you see. No, I\u2019m wrong, his goodness was like the slow fire that descends from the heavens and settles over your soul and convinces you, numbs you, makes you feel you\u2019re nothing much but gives you hope that with meditation, integrity, and honor you may eventually become blessed yourself. You see, Denis, without knowing it or wanting it, was truly a saint. Like any saint, I suppose, he could be fearsome and terrifying in his greatness, that greatness of which he was unaware. Implacably rigorous in pursuing a goodness he clearly didn\u2019t register. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d \u201cMe? But, you understand, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d \u201cYou did, though, even if you were too young to remember. And what matters in all this is that he knew you well, he raised you, he cared for you like his own daughter, and he loved you the same way, happily, passionately. It was because of you that he refused to have a child with me, out of a monstrously virtuous fidelity to his memory of that tiny girl, you. \u2018I can\u2019t let another child into my memory,\u2019 he would tell me. \u2018I can\u2019t think of creating any competition between my memory of Mimi and the memory I might have of another little girl.\u2019 And I answered, \u2018But what makes you think you\u2019d lose our child, too?\u2019 And he said, \u2018It happens. I owe it to Mimi to forever think of her as the only child I ever loved.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not dead!\u201d \u201cHe lost you\u2014it\u2019s the same thing. As I understand it, your mother took you away one day, left him just like that, and of course you went with her. Denis\u2019s glorious simplicity shielded him from hard feelings, and even from pointless anguish, from vainly protracted grief. He endured his lot with a smile. And, at the same time, he resolved to remain forever the father of only one child, you. Oh, not, as you must already understand, to spare himself other sorrows. He never gave that a thought. He had no fear of sorrow, and he didn\u2019t wallow in it. It\u2019s just that the inexorable, unyielding nature of his marvellous humanity had led him to decide that because he\u2019d loved you desperately, and because you\u2019d been taken away from him without your wanting it at all, he owed it to you never to attach himself to any other child, ever.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! It\u2019s absurd!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. That was Denis. That was why I left him. I went on to have the children I wanted, of course, with other men. But I miss the child Denis and I would have had, so I can\u2019t help resenting you a little. Forgive me, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The strange damage that goodness can do! When I asked R\u00e9gine how she felt about my wish to meet in person, she seemed surprised and shocked, as if I were proposing something utterly immoral. \u201cWhat reason would I have for meeting you? The adult that you are has no place in my life, you don\u2019t interest me. And also I want to forget the good Denis\u2014I\u2019ve been working on that all this time. Meet you? Who do you think you are? How indecent! You do not interest me, Madame. To me, Madame, you are only the faded reflection of a child who caused my unhappiness. I couldn\u2019t hate the little girl Denis so loved that he couldn\u2019t imagine giving the smallest share of his unlimited tenderness to any other, even his own\u2014I couldn\u2019t hate her, because you can\u2019t hate a child. But the woman you\u2019ve become I can only resent, however unfair that may be.\u201d Although it was hard, I decided not to ask for R\u00e9gine\u2019s forgiveness. I asked only if she knew where the good Denis lived. \u201cI do not, and I have no wish to. I\u2019m not good. I haven\u2019t entirely freed myself from anger and acrimony, brooding and pointless self-pity. I\u2019m quite sure that Denis, in his radiant, indifferent goodness, never broods. Happy are the blessed! Does he remember me? Or has he, for my own good, erased me from his memory? If you meet him, tell him about me, I\u2019m begging you, mention R\u00e9gine. . . .\u201d I wasn\u2019t good, either. If ever I did have the chance to meet Denis, I would certainly not speak the name of this R\u00e9gine, who had, there\u2019s no other word for it, cursed me. I wasn\u2019t good, either. I tried not to be proud of that. I would have been ashamed of my pride, but still proud.",

Though hesitant, Ursula gently probed further, her natural curiosity tempered by compassion as she asked about the circumstances surrounding their deaths.

As their conversation continued, the weight of Lilian's loss became increasingly palpable, particularly when she confessed that Trevor's stories, once a source of solace and escape, now seemed permanently beyond her reach. The raw reality of her experience had created an insurmountable barrier between her and the fictional worlds she once inhabited, leaving her to grapple with a pain so profound it defied the comfort of literature.

Roscoe, a whimsical man with a penchant for controlling his daily activities, was struggling to cope with his hearing issues, which necessitated a strict routine of walks, exercise, and watching TV with subtitles. Despite Flavia's offers to assist him with bathing, Roscoe insisted on maintaining his independence, a trait that was both admirable and frustrating. The conversation also touched on Roscoe's reluctance to visit a property upstate, which he referred to as \"the farm,\" much to Veronica's chagrin, who instead called it \"the country house.\" As the days went by, Roscoe's engagement with Flavia began to wane, and he eventually stopped responding to her questions or expressing his preferences, even when it resulted in an unwanted lunch. Flavia rationalized his silence as a natural part of his deterioration, a trend that continued during her subsequent visits, leaving her to wonder about the complexities of Roscoe's character and the intricacies of his relationships with those around him.

However, upon noticing Veronica's grim expression, Flavia immediately sensed a shift in the conversation and was relieved that she hadn't shared Roscoe's exhortations to the deceased Bill, which would have undoubtedly led to a more somber tone. Roscoe, a whimsical man with a penchant for controlling his daily activities, was struggling to cope with his hearing issues, which necessitated a strict routine of walks, exercise, and watching TV with subtitles. Despite Flavia's offers to assist him with bathing, Roscoe insisted on maintaining his independence, a trait that was both admirable and frustrating. The conversation also touched on Roscoe's reluctance to visit a property upstate, which he referred to as \"the farm,\" much to Veronica's chagrin, who instead called it \"the country house.\" As the days went by, Roscoe's engagement with Flavia began to wane, and he eventually stopped responding to her questions or expressing his preferences, even when it resulted in an unwanted lunch. Flavia rationalized his silence as a natural part of his deterioration, a trend that continued during her subsequent visits, leaving her to wonder about the complexities of Roscoe's character and the intricacies of his relationships with those around him. As she observed his gradual withdrawal, Flavia couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness and loss, knowing that the Roscoe she once knew was slowly slipping away.\n\nParagraph 2:\nNo. And then, feeling sure that it will cause no trouble\u2014why would it?\u2014Flavia volunteers information about the supposed talking-monkey movie. Veronica looks grim. And Flavia gets the distinct sensation that their talk has rounded a corner. She is glad that she kept Roscoe\u2019s exhortations to the dead Bill to herself. Interactions with Roscoe go on as before. He is a man of whims, and nobody knows this better than Flavia. Walks, exercise (or not), the constantly blaring TV (because Roscoe\u2019s hearing is another diminishment in his life)\u2014Roscoe is the master of his days. What he says always, always goes. Even the infrequent bathing, for which he turns down Flavia\u2019s help. Even when she tells him, There\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t seen before. Even the undriven car, sitting in the garage. It\u2019s there because there is a property upstate, what Roscoe calls \u201cthe cottage\u201d and Veronica \u201cthe country house.\u201d The few times a drive there is proposed, there is little energy in the idea.

My assumptions were confirmed later in the evening when he introduced himself as a gas engineer.

Her latest project, \"Interrogating Graham/Pence,\" had been percolating in her mind for months, and she was eager to share it with an old acquaintance, Eddie Walsh, over lunch at a nearby Thai restaurant. As she carefully placed a few of the Polaroids on the paper, she thought back to their time as undergraduates, when they had bonded over late nights spent covered in clay and glaze in their ceramics class. Irene had always been drawn to Eddie's charismatic personality and sharp wit, and though they had lost touch after graduation, she had kept tabs on his successful career in investment. Meanwhile, Irene had taken a more circuitous route, initially pursuing a career in product development before eventually returning to her artistic roots. As she packed up her bag with the handwritten questions she planned to ask Eddie, she couldn't help but think about the divergent paths their lives had taken - Eddie, with his high-powered job and beautiful family, and Irene, with her more unconventional career choices and own family, which included two rambunctious kids and a loving partner. Despite their differing trajectories, Irene was excited to reconnect with Eddie and hear his thoughts on the Modesto Manifesto, also known as the Billy Graham Rule or the Mike Pence Rule, which was the central theme of her project. She had carefully crafted a series of questions, ranging from the personal to the philosophical, and was eager to hear Eddie's responses, but she planned to wait until after they had eaten to broach the subject. As she headed out the door, Irene felt a sense of anticipation building - what would Eddie think of her project, and how would he respond to her probing questions? She pushed the thoughts aside, focusing instead on the prospect of a delicious meal and some much-needed catch-up time with an old friend. The Thai restaurant was already bustling with activity when Irene arrived, and she spotted Eddie chatting with the hostess, his trademark smile lighting up the room. As they hugged hello, Irene felt a sense of ease wash over her - despite the years that had passed, their connection remained strong, and she knew that their conversation would be just as engaging as it had been all those years ago in ceramics class. For now, though, they would just enjoy each other's company, savoring the flavors of their meal and the warmth of their reunion, before diving into the more serious topics that Irene had in store.",

Her latest project, \"Interrogating Graham/Pence,\" had been percolating in her mind for months, and she was eager to share it with an old acquaintance, Eddie Walsh, over lunch at a nearby Thai restaurant. As she carefully placed a few of the Polaroids on the paper, she thought back to their time as undergraduates, when they had bonded over late nights spent covered in clay and glaze in their ceramics class. Irene had always been drawn to Eddie's charismatic personality and sharp wit, and though they had lost touch after graduation, she had kept tabs on his successful career in investment. Meanwhile, Irene had taken a more circuitous route, initially pursuing a career in product development before eventually returning to her artistic roots. As she packed up her bag with the handwritten questions she planned to ask Eddie, she couldn't help but think about the divergent paths their lives had taken - Eddie, with his high-powered job and beautiful family, and Irene, with her more unconventional career choices and own family, which included two rambunctious kids and a loving partner. Despite their differing trajectories, Irene was excited to reconnect with Eddie and hear his thoughts on the Modesto Manifesto, also known as the Billy Graham Rule or the Mike Pence Rule, which was the central theme of her project. She had carefully crafted a series of questions, ranging from the personal to the philosophical, and was eager to hear Eddie's responses, but she planned to wait until after they had eaten to broach the subject. As she headed out the door, Irene felt a sense of anticipation building - what would Eddie think of her project, and how would he respond to her probing questions? She pushed the thoughts aside, focusing instead on the prospect of a delicious meal and some much-needed catch-up time with an old friend. The Thai restaurant was already bustling with activity when Irene arrived, and she spotted Eddie chatting with the hostess, his trademark smile lighting up the room. As they hugged hello, Irene felt a sense of ease wash over her - despite the years that had passed, their connection remained strong, and she knew that their conversation would be just as engaging as it had been all those years ago in ceramics class. For now, though, they would just enjoy each other's company, savoring the flavors of their meal and the warmth of their reunion, before diving into the more serious topics that Irene had in store.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAudio: Curtis Sittenfeld reads. Irene\u2019s medium, the one in which she has exhibited at galleries, is textiles, but for \u201cInterrogating Graham/Pence\u201d she decides to use Polaroid photos and off-white Tintoretto paper.

Why do you call him the good Denis?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how people speak of him to me. Is it not true?\u201d \u201cOh, it is, it is. Oh, yes, yes. The too good Denis, if you see what I mean, the excessively good Denis, perhaps, but, yes, he was good, I suppose.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not sure?\u201d \u201cOh, I am, I am. His goodness was like a thunderbolt, you see. No, I\u2019m wrong, his goodness was like the slow fire that descends from the heavens and settles over your soul and convinces you, numbs you, makes you feel you\u2019re nothing much but gives you hope that with meditation, integrity, and honor you may eventually become blessed yourself. You see, Denis, without knowing it or wanting it, was truly a saint. Like any saint, I suppose, he could be fearsome and terrifying in his greatness, that greatness of which he was unaware. Implacably rigorous in pursuing a goodness he clearly didn\u2019t register. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d \u201cMe? But, you understand, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d \u201cYou did, though, even if you were too young to remember. And what matters in all this is that he knew you well, he raised you, he cared for you like his own daughter, and he loved you the same way, happily, passionately. It was because of you that he refused to have a child with me, out of a monstrously virtuous fidelity to his memory of that tiny girl, you. \u2018I can\u2019t let another child into my memory,\u2019 he would tell me. \u2018I can\u2019t think of creating any competition between my memory of Mimi and the memory I might have of another little girl.\u2019 And I answered, \u2018But what makes you think you\u2019d lose our child, too?\u2019 And he said, \u2018It happens. I owe it to Mimi to forever think of her as the only child I ever loved.\u2019\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m not dead!\u201d \u201cHe lost you\u2014it\u2019s the same thing. As I understand it, your mother took you away one day, left him just like that, and of course you went with her. Denis\u2019s glorious simplicity shielded him from hard feelings, and even from pointless anguish, from vainly protracted grief. He endured his lot with a smile. And, at the same time, he resolved to remain forever the father of only one child, you. Oh, not, as you must already understand, to spare himself other sorrows. He never gave that a thought. He had no fear of sorrow, and he didn\u2019t wallow in it. It\u2019s just that the inexorable, unyielding nature of his marvellous humanity had led him to decide that because he\u2019d loved you desperately, and because you\u2019d been taken away from him without your wanting it at all, he owed it to you never to attach himself to any other child, ever.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! It\u2019s absurd!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. That was Denis. That was why I left him. I went on to have the children I wanted, of course, with other men. But I miss the child Denis and I would have had, so I can\u2019t help resenting you a little. Forgive me, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d The strange damage that goodness can do! When I asked R\u00e9gine how she felt about my wish to meet in person, she seemed surprised and shocked, as if I were proposing something utterly immoral. \u201cWhat reason would I have for meeting you? The adult that you are has no place in my life, you don\u2019t interest me. And also I want to forget the good Denis\u2014I\u2019ve been working on that all this time. Meet you? Who do you think you are? How indecent! You do not interest me, Madame. To me, Madame, you are only the faded reflection of a child who caused my unhappiness. I couldn\u2019t hate the little girl Denis so loved that he couldn\u2019t imagine giving the smallest share of his unlimited tenderness to any other, even his own\u2014I couldn\u2019t hate her, because you can\u2019t hate a child. But the woman you\u2019ve become I can only resent, however unfair that may be.\u201d Although it was hard, I decided not to ask for R\u00e9gine\u2019s forgiveness. I asked only if she knew where the good Denis lived. \u201cI do not, and I have no wish to. I\u2019m not good. I haven\u2019t entirely freed myself from anger and acrimony, brooding and pointless self-pity. I\u2019m quite sure that Denis, in his radiant, indifferent goodness, never broods. Happy are the blessed! Does he remember me? Or has he, for my own good, erased me from his memory? If you meet him, tell him about me, I\u2019m begging you, mention R\u00e9gine. . . .\u201d I wasn\u2019t good, either. If ever I did have the chance to meet Denis, I would certainly not speak the name of this R\u00e9gine, who had, there\u2019s no other word for it, cursed me. I wasn\u2019t good, either.

    "paragraph2": "I first learned about R\u00e9gine through a series of peculiar circumstances that revolved around Denis, whom everyone referred to as \"the good Denis,\" and this encounter would ultimately reveal a complex web of emotions and unspoken histories that I never could have anticipated. The story unfolded gradually, with R\u00e9gine eventually sharing the profound impact Denis had on her life, but what she revealed next shook me to my core \u2013 Denis had harbored an intense, almost sacred love for me when I was a child, so much so that it had prevented him from having children with her, a fact that had caused her immense pain and resentment over the years. As she recounted her story, I could feel the weight of her words, heavy with years of suppressed emotions and unfulfilled dreams, all somehow connected to my unknowing presence in Denis's life. Her revelation was both touching and disturbing, painting a picture of Denis as a man whose capacity for love had somehow become fixated on a child \u2013 me \u2013 to the detriment of his adult relationships, particularly his relationship with R\u00e9gine. The complexity of her feelings was evident in how she spoke about Denis, mixing reverence for his saintly nature with the bitter acknowledgment of how his devotion to me had ultimately led to her own unhappiness. When I expressed a desire to meet her in person, perhaps hoping to bridge this unexpected gap between us or offer some form of reconciliation, she firmly rejected the idea, making it clear that she preferred to forget both Denis and her resentment towards me as an adult. Her rejection forced me to confront my own role in this complicated narrative, though I had been merely a child and unaware of the impact my presence had on their lives. As I reflected on this situation, I became acutely aware of my own lack of goodness, particularly in comparison to Denis's apparent saintliness, and I made the conscious decision not to seek R\u00e9gine's forgiveness, understanding that some wounds are better left untouched. This experience left me with a peculiar resolution: if I ever were to encounter Denis again, I would keep my knowledge of R\u00e9gine and her story buried deep within me, maintaining the silence that she so desperately sought. The whole situation had revealed layers of human complexity I hadn't expected to encounter \u2013 how one person's pure love could inadvertently cause another's suffering, how childhood innocence could unknowingly cast long shadows into adult lives, and how the past continues to shape our present in ways we can never fully understand. The story of R\u00e9gine, Denis, and my unwitting role in their narrative became a testament to the intricate ways in which human lives intersect and affect one another, often without our knowledge or consent, and how some relationships, despite their significance, are better left in the realm of memory rather than pursued into the present. This realization came with a certain melancholy, an understanding that sometimes the kindest action is to respect the distances that others choose to maintain, even when those distances are born from pain and resentment that we didn't intentionally cause. The entire experience left me with a profound appreciation for the complexity of human relationships and the way that love, even in its purest form, can sometimes lead to unexpected consequences that ripple through time, affecting lives in ways we could never predict or fully comprehend. The situation with R\u00e9gine and Denis had become a lesson in the delicate balance between understanding and action, between the desire to make amends and the wisdom to know when to step back, and ultimately, about the complicated nature of human",

It was fascinating to observe how casting stars like Ortega could generate such a fervent interest in films and festivals alike. This stood in stark contrast to the previous year's festival, which had been notably subdued due to an actors' strike that left it devoid of A-list celebrities.

Tommy spoke with a mixture of admiration and sadness about Samantha, acknowledging the weight of her responsibility.

When Rafik brought afternoon tea into the living room, K.K. could hear the typewriter clacking in the background. It stopped, and then Husna knocked. She opened the door, showing her head without entering. \u201cCome in, my dear.\u201d Husna\u2019s cultivation of Rafik had progressed to the point where he included an extra cup on the tea trolley. She drew herself forward and made K.K.\u2019s tea exactly as he liked it. A boy passed a plate of biscuits, while Rafik stood back on his heels by the door. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here,\u201d Husna said, \u201ceverything is so nice and everyone is pleasant. These biscuits, the tea. Shah Sahib tries so hard to teach me the typing, though I can\u2019t seem to learn.\u201d She held out her hands and spread her fingers in front of him, like a cat stretching. \u201cMy hands are so tiny, I can\u2019t reach the keys. But then all of me is small.\u201d She wore a tight kurta, showing the cleft of her breasts, which jutted out from her muscular youthful torso. Their eyes met; they both saw the joke, and he allowed himself a tight-lipped smile, his composed expression becoming avid and boyish. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been telling you about,\u201d Husna purred, putting her hand on his arm. \u201cYour crocodile smile, the one I like.\u201d After pausing for a moment, she lowered her eyes and said in a meek voice, \u201cBut soon I won\u2019t be able to come here. The begum is going on umrah, so I\u2019ll have to be in charge of her house.\u201d \u201cNot umrah again!\u201d K.K. said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a vice with her. But, darling, don\u2019t be ridiculous. If she\u2019s away, you can come even more regularly.\u201d\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

She often wonders if being their biological child would have granted her deeper insight into their dynamic, a question that haunts her even now. Her own romantic history bears the weight of two failed marriages, with Peter's words echoing in her mind about her inability to take herself seriously\u2014a observation that cuts deeper than she'd care to admit. The label \"toxic\" bestowed upon her by both ex-husbands doesn't sting as much as it perhaps should; instead, she finds herself respecting their clarity in identifying the poison and choosing self-preservation over slow deterioration. Her attention shifts to the peculiar relationship between Peipei and Mr. Wu, where she's learned to navigate the delicate balance of maintaining professional courtesy while carefully avoiding any interaction that might trigger Peipei's possessive nature. Bella observes how Peipei's devotion to Mr. Wu has transcended the typical boundaries of youthful infatuation, transforming into something more permanent and perhaps equally toxic in its own right. The fairy-tale quality of Peipei's unwavering loyalty seems to Bella like another form of poison, one that has seeped so deeply into the fabric of their relationship that it's become indistinguishable from love itself, making her question the fine line between dedication and destruction in matters of the heart.",

The year is remembered for \u201cStar Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d which had opened in March and by August was winding down its initial colonization of the cultural imagination. It was known for existential identity crackups, and a pervasive itch of anomie, that you could sense in \u201cOffice Space,\u201d \u201cElection,\u201d \u201cDick\u201d and \u201cFight Club,\u201d which weren\u2019t hits, but also in \u201cAmerican Pie,\u201d which very much was. So Raftery\u2019s breathless tone seems right. It was the last most-exciting period for American moviegoing. It was the last most-exciting time to write about the movies.",
    "paragraph2": "In 1999, the cinematic landscape was a vibrant tapestry of innovation and experimentation. It was the year that M. Night Shyamalan's twisty thriller and \"The Blair Witch Project\" redefined the horror genre, while \"American Beauty\" and \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace\" dominated the box office. Meanwhile, \"The Matrix\" was busy blowing minds with its groundbreaking special effects. But beneath the surface, a sense of existential identity crises and anomie was brewing, as seen in films like \"Office Space,\" \"Election,\" \"Dick,\" \"Fight Club,\" and \"American Pie.\" As critic Raftery would likely exclaim with characteristic enthusiasm, 1999 was a thrilling time for American cinema, marked by a sense of creative freedom and risk-taking that would soon become a distant memory. It was, in many ways, the last exciting era for both moviegoing and writing about movies.",

The year is remembered for \u201cStar Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d which had opened in March and by August was winding down its initial colonization of the cultural imagination. It was known for existential identity crackups, and a pervasive itch of anomie, that you could sense in \u201cOffice Space,\u201d \u201cElection,\u201d \u201cDick\u201d and \u201cFight Club,\u201d which weren\u2019t hits, but also in \u201cAmerican Pie,\u201d which very much was. So Raftery\u2019s breathless tone seems right. It was the last most-exciting period for American moviegoing. It was the last most-exciting time to write about the movies.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn 1999, the cinematic landscape was a vibrant tapestry of innovation and experimentation. It was the year that M. Night Shyamalan's twisty thriller and \"The Blair Witch Project\" redefined the horror genre, while \"American Beauty\" and \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace\" dominated the box office. Meanwhile, \"The Matrix\" was busy blowing minds with its groundbreaking special effects. But beneath the surface, a sense of existential identity crises and anomie was brewing, as seen in films like \"Office Space,\" \"Election,\" \"Dick,\" \"Fight Club,\" and \"American Pie.\" As critic Raftery would likely exclaim with characteristic enthusiasm, 1999 was a thrilling time for American cinema, marked by a sense of creative freedom and risk-taking that would soon become a distant memory. It was, in many ways, the last exciting era for both moviegoing and writing about movies.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Her mind was occupied with worry about her friend Shirlee, whose presence had always been a source of comfort and solace. Theo wished that Shirlee could spend the night, offering a reprieve from the oppressive atmosphere that seemed to suffocate her within the confines of her own home. However, her mother, Jane, had firmly and repeatedly opposed such an arrangement, citing reasons that Theo could not fully comprehend. While Jane was occupied in the tub, Theo seized the moment, her heart pounding with a rebellious thrill, and called Shirlee, whispering her invitation. Shirlee, eager to support her friend, slipped over to Theo's house under the cover of darkness. They had scarcely begun to enjoy each other's company when Jane, her bath abruptly concluded, discovered their clandestine meeting. Her anger was a force of nature, crashing into the room with a fury that left Theo breathless. Jane's confrontation with Theo was intense, her eyes blazing with a mix of betrayal and disapproval, and it quickly escalated into a physical altercation. In a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity, Jane grabbed an extension cord, wielding it with the intent to discipline, a symbol of her need to control and dominate. The blows rained down on Theo, each one stinging with pain and the weight of unspoken words. Yet, through the haze of pain and adrenaline, Theo resisted, refusing to submit to the authority that sought to break her spirit. In the struggle, Theo managed to sidestep Jane's aggression, causing her to stumble and fall, a brief triumph that left Theo breathless and guilt-ridden. The tension between Theo and her mother was as palpable as the air they breathed, a constant reminder of the chasm that had grown between them. Jane, in her anger, voiced her disapproval of Theo's friendship with Shirlee, lacing her words with derogatory comments that cut deeper than any physical blow. Theo stood there, feeling the weight of her mother's judgment, her heart aching with the desire to be understood, to be seen for who she truly was. She reflected on the situation, her thoughts a turbulent sea of emotions, a mixture of defiance and a desperate yearning for independence. In that moment, Theo contemplated her future, envisioning a life where she could carve out her own identity, free from the oppressive shadow of her mother's expectations. The paragraph captured the strained relationship between Theo and Jane, a dynamic fraught with unspoken tensions and unfulfilled desires, highlighting themes of control and rebellion, as Theo struggled to assert her identity in a world that seemed determined to stifle it. Through the chaos of the evening, Theo realized that her journey towards independence would be fraught with challenges, but it was a path she was determined to walk, with or without her mother's approval.

The more she thought about her friend, the more she thought Shirlee should be able to spend the night. Other people\u2019s friends spent the night at their houses. Jane was too unreasonable. While Jane was in the tub, Theo phoned Shirlee and asked if she still wanted to come over. The third time, they were too bold. Shirlee came earlier, around nine, so she could stay longer. Not an hour later, Jane was shaking the knob. \u201cWho you talking to, girl? Unlock this damn door.\u201d Before Theo could get to her feet, Jane had shouldered it open. Shirlee ran out the back of the house while Theo lit out for the living room with Jane on her heels swinging an extension cord. It landed on Theo\u2019s thighs, her shoulder, her cheek. Why did she have to be in only her drawers? Why had they been greedy? \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Roger said. \u201cDon\u2019t come out here, Roger,\u201d Jane growled.

She went to stand over Jane, wanted to mash her foot in her mother\u2019s face. \u201cGet from over me,\u201d Jane snapped. What the fuck was Jane mad about? She wasn\u2019t the one who had been assaulted. Theo\u2019s welts tightened and released, but the pain was interesting, not overwhelming. The worst was on her shoulder, where the skin was raw.

Just a few minutes ago, the song had her feeling like a goddess, but now she felt like a kicked dog. Jane was off the floor, looking for something. Theo flinched when she came near her.

The voice belonged to a man of perhaps seventy-one, who was sitting low behind a desk, sipping from a snifter of what looked like corrupted urine and talking on a phone that for an instant I took to be a large kitten.

I talked to David. Look, I\u2019m on board. I don\u2019t give a fuck about Hirschman, but my wife, Lydia, she won\u2019t shut up about \u2018Nana would have wanted to see her Albie as Zac Efron\u2019 or whatever.

The man looked at us like we had to be joking but then produced a two-inch piece of straw from the breast pocket of his jacket and snorted everything that was left, right from the plastic. He thumbed his nose and sniffed a few times, then gave a small shrug of disdain and settled, half sitting, on the front of the desk. \u201cThat coke sucks, but I\u2019ll tell you, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I was going to say: Stop giving so much of a shit.\u201d We blinked at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said. I love that you can ask people what they mean right after they\u2019ve said the most obvious things and almost invariably they\u2019ll assume that they are the ones who\u2019ve failed to be clear and go to elaborate lengths to make themselves understood. Wagner looked at me, then turned to Eli. \u201cYour friend\u2019s retarded,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I mean is\u2014look, if you care about something, like horses, go raise horses. Go ride them and fuck them or whatever people do with horses. Sell them to Arabs, I\u2019d guess. But if you\u2019re going to stay in this crappy business, and they\u2019re all crappy, stop giving a shit. Because you\u2019re here for one reason and you should know what that reason is. Do you?\u201d He looked from one of us to the other, then barked \u201cSonia!,\u201d and we jumped, but Sonia didn\u2019t. She just walked over and spanked us both insanely hard on the ass with her riding crop. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re here,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cis that you already have nice cars\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t, but I went along with the spirit of his admonition\u2014\u201cand girlfriends with that taut skin, and nice rentals in the hills\u2014or maybe you own?\u201d He looked at us doubtfully. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have the good stuff, do you, the really hard-to-come-by shit. You know what I\u2019m talking about: Envy. Serious, irrefutable reasons for people to envy you. And not just any sort of people, of course. You need people well informed enough to understand just how enviable you are. And people clever enough to know how to show their envy without being sycophants, and worldly enough to be charming company while they\u2019re envying you. . . . You need courtiers, see? Oh, they\u2019re better and worse than friends. They don\u2019t care about you, sure, but they understand the terms of your success far better than a friend ever could.

    "paragraph2": "As I followed Eli through the musty aisles of the library, the scent of old books and stale air filled my nostrils, and the soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead seemed to reverberate through my entire being. We had been working on our film project for months, and Eli, ever the networker, had insisted that we needed to get out and meet people, make connections, and get our names out there. I had reluctantly agreed, and so here we were, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispering patrons, on the hunt for someone, anyone, who might be able to help us break into the industry. That's when we saw him - Wagner, an older man with a commanding presence, sipping a drink from a flask and talking on his phone in hushed tones. He was a striking figure, with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy beard to match, and his eyes seemed to gleam with a knowing intensity that made me feel like an insect under a microscope. Nearby, an Amazonian woman with long, curly hair and a bright smile stood watching him, her eyes never leaving his face. Eli, undaunted by Wagner's formidable appearance, strode right up to him and introduced himself, explaining our film project and asking if he might be willing to offer some advice. At first, Wagner was dismissive, barely looking up from his phone as he muttered a few curt words, but Eli persisted, and eventually, Wagner's demeanor softened, and he began to engage with us. As we talked, I found myself drawn into Wagner's orbit, captivated by his world-weary cynicism and the way he seemed to see right through the fa\u00e7ade of the industry we were trying to break into. \"Don't care too much,\" he told us, his voice dripping with disdain. \"That's the secret to success. Don't get too attached, don't get too invested. Because the minute you do, someone will come along and rip it all away from you.\" Eli and I exchanged a skeptical glance, but Wagner just chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound, and continued, \"You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen it happen to the best of them. You want to make it in this business? Learn to not care.\" As he spoke, Sonia, the Amazonian woman, watched him with an intensity that bordered on devotion, and I found myself wondering what her story was, how she had ended up in Wagner's orbit. Wagner, seeming to sense my curiosity, smiled wryly and said, \"Sonia here knows all about pain. Real pain, not the fake stuff they peddle in the movies. She's been through hell and back, and she's still standing.\" Sonia's eyes never left Wagner's face, but I could sense a flicker of emotion behind them, a deep well of feeling that seemed to underscore Wagner's words. Eventually, Eli and I bid Wagner farewell, thanking him for his time and advice, and made our way out of the library, into the bright, cold sunlight. The encounter had left me feeling unsettled, unsure of what to make of Wagner's jaded perspective, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were just pawns in a much larger game. Later that night, at a New Year's Eve party, I found myself lost in thought, replaying the conversation with Wagner in my head. I had also been thinking about a conversation I had with Lily, a friend from college, about the futility of pursuing a romantic relationship. She had been going through a tough breakup, and I had",

He thumbed his nose and sniffed a few times, then gave a small shrug of disdain and settled, half sitting, on the front of the desk. \u201cThat coke sucks, but I\u2019ll tell you, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I was going to say: Stop giving so much of a shit.\u201d We blinked at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said. I love that you can ask people what they mean right after they\u2019ve said the most obvious things and almost invariably they\u2019ll assume that they are the ones who\u2019ve failed to be clear and go to elaborate lengths to make themselves understood. Wagner looked at me, then turned to Eli. \u201cYour friend\u2019s retarded,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I mean is\u2014look, if you care about something, like horses, go raise horses. Go ride them and fuck them or whatever people do with horses. Sell them to Arabs, I\u2019d guess. But if you\u2019re going to stay in this crappy business, and they\u2019re all crappy, stop giving a shit. Because you\u2019re here for one reason and you should know what that reason is. Do you?\u201d He looked from one of us to the other, then barked \u201cSonia!,\u201d and we jumped, but Sonia didn\u2019t. She just walked over and spanked us both insanely hard on the ass with her riding crop. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re here,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cis that you already have nice cars\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t, but I went along with the spirit of his admonition\u2014\u201cand girlfriends with that taut skin, and nice rentals in the hills\u2014or maybe you own?\u201d He looked at us doubtfully. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have the good stuff, do you, the really hard-to-come-by shit. You know what I\u2019m talking about: Envy. Serious, irrefutable reasons for people to envy you. And not just any sort of people, of course. You need people well informed enough to understand just how enviable you are. And people clever enough to know how to show their envy without being sycophants, and worldly enough to be charming company while they\u2019re envying you. . . . You need courtiers, see? Oh, they\u2019re better and worse than friends. They don\u2019t care about you, sure, but they understand the terms of your success far better than a friend ever could. And so when you forget why you did all the shit you did, all you have t\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I followed Eli through the musty aisles of the library, the scent of old books and stale air filled my nostrils, and the soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead seemed to reverberate through my entire being. We had been working on our film project for months, and Eli, ever the networker, had insisted that we needed to get out and meet people, make connections, and get our names out there. I had reluctantly agreed, and so here we were, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispering patrons, on the hunt for someone, anyone, who might be able to help us break into the industry. That's when we saw him - Wagner, an older man with a commanding presence, sipping a drink from a flask and talking on his phone in hushed tones. He was a striking figure, with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy beard to match, and his eyes seemed to gleam with a knowing intensity that made me feel like an insect under a microscope. Nearby, an Amazonian woman with long, curly hair and a bright smile stood watching him, her eyes never leaving his face. Eli, undaunted by Wagner's formidable appearance, strode right up to him and introduced himself, explaining our film project and asking if he might be willing to offer some advice. At first, Wagner was dismissive, barely looking up from his phone as he muttered a few curt words, but Eli persisted, and eventually, Wagner's demeanor softened, and he began to engage with us. As we talked, I found myself drawn into Wagner's orbit, captivated by his world-weary cynicism and the way he seemed to see right through the fa\u00e7ade of the industry we were trying to break into. \"Don't care too much,\" he told us, his voice dripping with disdain. \"That's the secret to success. Don't get too attached, don't get too invested. Because the minute you do, someone will come along and rip it all away from you.\" Eli and I exchanged a skeptical glance, but Wagner just chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound, and continued, \"You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen it happen to the best of them. You want to make it in this business? Learn to not care.\" As he spoke, Sonia, the Amazonian woman, watched him with an intensity that bordered on devotion, and I found myself wondering what her story was, how she had ended up in Wagner's orbit. Wagner, seeming to sense my curiosity, smiled wryly and said, \"Sonia here knows all about pain. Real pain, not the fake stuff they peddle in the movies. She's been through hell and back, and she's still standing.\" Sonia's eyes never left Wagner's face, but I could sense a flicker of emotion behind them, a deep well of feeling that seemed to underscore Wagner's words. Eventually, Eli and I bid Wagner farewell, thanking him for his time and advice, and made our way out of the library, into the bright, cold sunlight. The encounter had left me feeling unsettled, unsure of what to make of Wagner's jaded perspective, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were just pawns in a much larger game. Later that night, at a New Year's Eve party, I found myself lost in thought, replaying the conversation with Wagner in my head. I had also been thinking about a conversation I had with Lily, a friend from college, about the futility of pursuing a romantic relationship. She had been going through a tough breakup, and I had\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Ah, Ben Shmen, Morse thought, ten Bens weren\u2019t worth a single Robert, although he couldn\u2019t think of one area in which Robert was superior or even equal to Ben, the little smarty-pants, although certainly he had nothing against Ben, Ben being a mere boy, but if Ben thought for a minute that his being more accomplished and friendly and talented than Robert somehow entitled him to lord it over Robert, Ben had another think coming, not that Ben had ever actually lorded it over Robert.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

There was a sense of urgency in her, a desire to seize the day and create meaningful moments with her daughter, Amalie. This morning felt different, charged with an energy that compelled Toni to shake up their routine. Inspired by her own cherished childhood memories, she decided to take Amalie to a doughnut shop before school, a place that held its own kind of magic. As they drove through the awakening city, Toni marveled at how her daughter\u2019s curiosity seemed to mirror her own. At the shop, the warm, sweet aroma enveloped them, and Toni watched with delight as Amalie\u2019s eyes widened with wonder at the array of colorful doughnuts. As they settled into a cozy booth, their conversation naturally turned to the cosmos, a topic that had recently captivated Amalie, thanks to the kindness of a man named Marco. Toni felt a deep gratitude towards Marco, who had gifted Amalie a telescope, opening up a universe of exploration and learning for her inquisitive daughter. The generosity of his gesture had left a lasting impression on both mother and daughter, and Toni found herself reflecting on the impact of kindness and the importance of nurturing Amalie's burgeoning interests. In this moment, the doughnut shop became more than just a backdrop; it was a space where Toni and Amalie could celebrate not only the sweetness of their treats but also the sweetness of their bond. Toni felt a surge of ambition and protectiveness as she watched Amalie, who seemed so small yet so full of potential, a little girl with dreams as vast as the night sky. As they finished their breakfast and prepared to leave, Toni noticed a man trying to catch Amalie\u2019s attention. Without missing a beat, Amalie simply ignored him, her confidence and independence shining through. Toni felt a swell of pride, recognizing the strength and self-assurance her daughter was developing. It was a moment of reassurance for Toni, knowing that Amalie possessed the ability to navigate the world with poise and discernment. With a contented sigh, they returned to the car, the morning sun casting a golden hue over them. As they drove towards school, the radio played a familiar tune, and without hesitation, both mother and daughter began to sing along, their voices mingling in harmony. It was a simple yet profound moment, encapsulating the connection and contentment they shared. For Toni, these moments were invaluable, a reminder of the love and joy that formed the foundation of their life together. The drive became a journey of shared happiness, a testament to the bond they nurtured every single day.",

She\u2019d sneaked out like a teen-ager and come home different, out of joint, as if she\u2019d lost her virginity. \u201cI see a satellite,\u201d Amalie announced, but Toni\u2019s focus was earthbound. She was planning something in her head. She felt it all there, laid out. A structure she could borrow. A new sense of urgency. \u201cI see Mars.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, honey.\u201d He would be another set of eyes. He would keep an eye. The moment she decided, she decided everything.

Slow down, she told herself, but then she thought, Why should I slow down? She had been too humble, too modest. The edges of the sky lightened. A seam appeared in the horizon, and they went inside.

Toni allowed Amalie a few sips of coffee. Sugar granules sparkled on her cheeks. People came and went. Mostly old men.

He was trying to please her, the only child in the place. Amalie winced like a woman with a hangover, looked out the window. The Santa crackled dementedly. Toni said, \u201cWe should give him a doughnut.\u201d \u201cHim?\u201d She thought Toni meant the man who started up the Santa. \u201cMarco.\u201d \u201cWait. Who\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cThe man who gave you the telescope. His name is Marco.\u201d Amalie stopped eating.

Lemon were her least favorite. Then she tapped her watch, reminded her mother it was a school day. As they were leaving, she passed the man who had made the Santa dance, and he put his hand out, the way one does for a high five, a meaty palm, but Amalie sailed by, did not pause. Amalie my anomaly, her mother thought. Good girl. Just like that. In the parking lot, a big black bird tore at a garbage bag. Empty cans skidded across the pavement. A storm was coming, like Amalie had said. They were stuffed to the gills with sugar and caffeine. The school nurse would call in two hours.

These carefully wrapped gifts evolved into something far more profound - they became my lifeline, as essential as the air I breathed and the community that surrounded me. But life had other plans, and the sudden loss of both my parents left me adrift at twenty-two, with no more guidance to come, no more letters to anticipate. All that remained was a box of my mother's packages, a tangible connection to her love and foresight. Now, at thirty, I live in my Brooklyn apartment with this box that grows lighter with each passing year. Inside, only three unopened packages remain, each wrapped in shiny cardboard and tied with pink ribbon, waiting for life's biggest moments: Engagement, Wedding, and First Baby. These final gifts stand as silent guardians of future milestones, holding within their carefully preserved wrapping the last pieces of maternal guidance I'll ever receive.",

    "paragraph1": "As I followed Eli through the musty aisles of the library, the scent of old books and stale air filled my nostrils, and the soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead seemed to reverberate through my entire being. We had been working on our film project for months, and Eli, ever the networker, had insisted that we needed to get out and meet people, make connections, and get our names out there. I had reluctantly agreed, and so here we were, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispering patrons, on the hunt for someone, anyone, who might be able to help us break into the industry. That's when we saw him - Wagner, an older man with a commanding presence, sipping a drink from a flask and talking on his phone in hushed tones. He was a striking figure, with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy beard to match, and his eyes seemed to gleam with a knowing intensity that made me feel like an insect under a microscope. Nearby, an Amazonian woman with long, curly hair and a bright smile stood watching him, her eyes never leaving his face. Eli, undaunted by Wagner's formidable appearance, strode right up to him and introduced himself, explaining our film project and asking if he might be willing to offer some advice. At first, Wagner was dismissive, barely looking up from his phone as he muttered a few curt words, but Eli persisted, and eventually, Wagner's demeanor softened, and he began to engage with us. As we talked, I found myself drawn into Wagner's orbit, captivated by his world-weary cynicism and the way he seemed to see right through the fa\u00e7ade of the industry we were trying to break into. \"Don't care too much,\" he told us, his voice dripping with disdain. \"That's the secret to success. Don't get too attached, don't get too invested. Because the minute you do, someone will come along and rip it all away from you.\" Eli and I exchanged a skeptical glance, but Wagner just chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound, and continued, \"You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen it happen to the best of them. You want to make it in this business? Learn to not care.\" As he spoke, Sonia, the Amazonian woman, watched him with an intensity that bordered on devotion, and I found myself wondering what her story was, how she had ended up in Wagner's orbit. Wagner, seeming to sense my curiosity, smiled wryly and said, \"Sonia here knows all about pain. Real pain, not the fake stuff they peddle in the movies. She's been through hell and back, and she's still standing.\" Sonia's eyes never left Wagner's face, but I could sense a flicker of emotion behind them, a deep well of feeling that seemed to underscore Wagner's words. Eventually, Eli and I bid Wagner farewell, thanking him for his time and advice, and made our way out of the library, into the bright, cold sunlight. The encounter had left me feeling unsettled, unsure of what to make of Wagner's jaded perspective, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were just pawns in a much larger game. Later that night, at a New Year's Eve party, I found myself lost in thought, replaying the conversation with Wagner in my head. I had also been thinking about a conversation I had with Lily, a friend from college, about the futility of pursuing a romantic relationship. She had been going through a tough breakup, and I had",
    "paragraph2": "It didn\u2019t take us all that long to find Wagner, though time had grown a bit fishy at this point. We scrabbled through doors and rooms, and when we got to the library a voice said, \u201cCome in, come in,\u201d as if it had been expecting us. The voice belonged to a man of perhaps seventy-one, who was sitting low behind a desk, sipping from a snifter of what looked like corrupted urine and talking on a phone that for an instant I took to be a large kitten.

I don\u2019t give a fuck about Hirschman, but my wife, Lydia, she won\u2019t shut up about \u2018Nana would have wanted to see her Albie as Zac Efron\u2019 or whatever.

The man looked at us like we had to be joking but then produced a two-inch piece of straw from the breast pocket of his jacket and snorted everything that was left, right from the plastic. He thumbed his nose and sniffed a few times, then gave a small shrug of disdain and settled, half sitting, on the front of the desk. \u201cThat coke sucks, but I\u2019ll tell you, anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s what I was going to say: Stop giving so much of a shit.\u201d We blinked at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I said. I love that you can ask people what they mean right after they\u2019ve said the most obvious things and almost invariably they\u2019ll assume that they are the ones who\u2019ve failed to be clear and go to elaborate lengths to make themselves understood. Wagner looked at me, then turned to Eli. \u201cYour friend\u2019s retarded,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I mean is\u2014look, if you care about something, like horses, go raise horses. Go ride them and fuck them or whatever people do with horses. Sell them to Arabs, I\u2019d guess. But if you\u2019re going to stay in this crappy business, and they\u2019re all crappy, stop giving a shit. Because you\u2019re here for one reason and you should know what that reason is. Do you?\u201d He looked from one of us to the other, then barked \u201cSonia!,\u201d and we jumped, but Sonia didn\u2019t. She just walked over and spanked us both insanely hard on the ass with her riding crop. \u201cThe reason you\u2019re here,\u201d Wagner said, \u201cis that you already have nice cars\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t, but I went along with the spirit of his admonition\u2014\u201cand girlfriends with that taut skin, and nice rentals in the hills\u2014or maybe you own?\u201d He looked at us doubtfully. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have the good stuff, do you, the really hard-to-come-by shit. You know what I\u2019m talking about: Envy. Serious, irrefutable reasons for people to envy you. And not just any sort of people, of course. You need people well informed enough to understand just how enviable you are. And people clever enough to know how to show their envy without being sycophants, and worldly enough to be charming company while they\u2019re envying you. . . . You need courtiers, see? Oh, they\u2019re better and worse than friends. They don\u2019t care about you, sure, but they understand the terms of your success far better than a friend ever could.

We had been working on our film project for months, and Eli, ever the networker, had insisted that we needed to get out and meet people, make connections, and get our names out there. I had reluctantly agreed, and so here we were, surrounded by dusty tomes and whispering patrons, on the hunt for someone, anyone, who might be able to help us break into the industry. That's when we saw him - Wagner, an older man with a commanding presence, sipping a drink from a flask and talking on his phone in hushed tones. He was a striking figure, with a wild shock of white hair and a bushy beard to match, and his eyes seemed to gleam with a knowing intensity that made me feel like an insect under a microscope. Nearby, an Amazonian woman with long, curly hair and a bright smile stood watching him, her eyes never leaving his face. Eli, undaunted by Wagner's formidable appearance, strode right up to him and introduced himself, explaining our film project and asking if he might be willing to offer some advice. At first, Wagner was dismissive, barely looking up from his phone as he muttered a few curt words, but Eli persisted, and eventually, Wagner's demeanor softened, and he began to engage with us. As we talked, I found myself drawn into Wagner's orbit, captivated by his world-weary cynicism and the way he seemed to see right through the fa\u00e7ade of the industry we were trying to break into. \"Don't care too much,\" he told us, his voice dripping with disdain. \"That's the secret to success. Don't get too attached, don't get too invested. Because the minute you do, someone will come along and rip it all away from you.\" Eli and I exchanged a skeptical glance, but Wagner just chuckled, a dry, mirthless sound, and continued, \"You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. I've been around the block a few times, and I've seen it happen to the best of them. You want to make it in this business? Learn to not care.\" As he spoke, Sonia, the Amazonian woman, watched him with an intensity that bordered on devotion, and I found myself wondering what her story was, how she had ended up in Wagner's orbit. Wagner, seeming to sense my curiosity, smiled wryly and said, \"Sonia here knows all about pain. Real pain, not the fake stuff they peddle in the movies. She's been through hell and back, and she's still standing.\" Sonia's eyes never left Wagner's face, but I could sense a flicker of emotion behind them, a deep well of feeling that seemed to underscore Wagner's words. Eventually, Eli and I bid Wagner farewell, thanking him for his time and advice, and made our way out of the library, into the bright, cold sunlight. The encounter had left me feeling unsettled, unsure of what to make of Wagner's jaded perspective, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were just pawns in a much larger game. Later that night, at a New Year's Eve party, I found myself lost in thought, replaying the conversation with Wagner in my head. I had also been thinking about a conversation I had with Lily, a friend from college, about the futility of pursuing a romantic relationship. She had been going through a tough breakup, and I had\n\nParagraph 2:\nIt didn\u2019t take us all that long to find Wagner, though time had grown a bit fishy at this point. We scrabbled through doors and rooms, and when we got to the library a voice said, \u201cCome in, come in,\u201d as if it had been expecting us. The voice belonged to a man of perhaps seventy-one, who was sitting low behind a desk, sipping from a snifter of what looked like corrupted urine and talking on a phone that for an instant I took to be a large kitten. It was such a striking sight that I almost missed the Amazonian woman standing to the side in a studded black leather bra and garters. I did a double take, but she didn\u2019t seem to register my gaze, just looked off glassily with impassive disgust and worked the tassels of her riding crop like a rosary. \u201cSatellite,\u201d Wagner told us, covering the mouthpiece with his hand.

    "paragraph1": "The church hall buzzed with anticipation as D.G.F. prepared to take the stage, with Monika positioned behind her drum kit, exchanging knowing glances with Katja and Elli as they readied their instruments. The peaceful atmosphere shattered when 88 Tommy and his gang of skinheads burst through the main entrance, their combat boots thundering against the wooden floor as they began overturning chairs and shoving audience members. Chaos erupted instantly, with screams filling the air and people scrambling toward the exits, while the skinheads methodically destroyed everything in their path. Monika's heart raced as she abandoned her drums and made a desperate dash for the side door, her fingers trembling as she pushed it open, only to find herself suddenly flanked by two men in dark raincoats who emerged from the shadows. Their grip was firm as they claimed to be there for her protection, but their rough handling suggested otherwise as they dragged her toward a waiting car despite her fierce struggles and protests. The men's faces remained impassive as they forced her into the backseat, their movements practiced and efficient, suggesting this wasn't their first such operation. The car wound through the darkening streets of Berlin until it reached a hairdresser's shop in Lichtenberg, its neon sign casting an eerie glow over the wet pavement.

The peaceful atmosphere shattered when 88 Tommy and his gang of skinheads burst through the main entrance, their combat boots thundering against the wooden floor as they began overturning chairs and shoving audience members. Chaos erupted instantly, with screams filling the air and people scrambling toward the exits, while the skinheads methodically destroyed everything in their path. Monika's heart raced as she abandoned her drums and made a desperate dash for the side door, her fingers trembling as she pushed it open, only to find herself suddenly flanked by two men in dark raincoats who emerged from the shadows. Their grip was firm as they claimed to be there for her protection, but their rough handling suggested otherwise as they dragged her toward a waiting car despite her fierce struggles and protests. The men's faces remained impassive as they forced her into the backseat, their movements practiced and efficient, suggesting this wasn't their first such operation. The car wound through the darkening streets of Berlin until it reached a hairdresser's shop in Lichtenberg, its neon sign casting an eerie glow over the wet pavement.

    "paragraph1": "Living in North Galway has been a peculiar experience, filled with moments that both amuse and perplex me. The locals here seem to carry an air of excessive sensuality, a notion that echoes historical observations, like those of Thackeray, who once commented on the behavior and attire of rural Irish women. While I find these musings amusing, John Murphy, a local acquaintance, often dismisses such romantic pursuits as relics of his past. His indifference is a stark contrast to the vibrant energy that pulses through the town. Lately, I've been contemplating selling my property and moving to Cambodia, a prospect that seems more appealing with each passing day. My thoughts, however, are interrupted by Nadia, who bursts in with a frantic account of an otter in the kitchen. True to her coldhearted nature, her panic is more about the disruption than the creature itself. When I investigate, I find the otter calmly lapping up soup, seemingly unperturbed by my presence. After some effort, I manage to shoo it outside, watching as it makes its way to higher ground rather than the usual tide-line rocks. This deviation concerns me, triggering thoughts of potential flooding. I turn to the locals for reassurance, including Bill Knott, who confidently tells me that it hasn't flooded in sixteen years and won\u2019t now. Despite his reassurances, my anxiety lingers, perhaps fueled by the quiet disdain I sense from the townsfolk. They seem to regard me as an outsider, someone who neglects their property and fails to grasp the rhythm of life here. This perception, whether true or imagined, only adds to my growing discontent. The otter incident, the locals' attitudes, and my own restless spirit converge, leaving me more convinced than ever that my future lies elsewhere, perhaps on the serene shores of Cambodia, far from the watchful eyes and whispered judgments of North Galway.",
    "paragraph2": "The people of this part of North Galway are oversexed. That is my belief. I had found a level of ribaldry that bordered on the paganistic. It goes back, of course. They lick it up off the crooked rocks. Thackeray, indeed, remarked on the corsetless dress of rural Irish women, and the fact that they kissed perfect strangers in greeting, their vast bosoms swinging. \u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d John Murphy said, \u201clike I\u2019m goin\u2019 to take a lep at the little bitch. My leppin\u2019 days are long fuckin\u2019 over.\u201d If I sold the place for even three-quarters of what I paid for it, I could buy half of Cambodia and do a Colonel fucking Kurtz on it. Lovely, coldhearted Nadia came running from the kitchen. She was as white as the fallen dead. \u201cIs otter!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cIs otter in kitchen!\u201d she cried. He was eating soup when I got there. Carrot and coriander from a ten-gallon pot. Normally, they are terribly skittish, otters, but this fellow was languorous as a surfer. Nervously, I shooed him toward the back door. He took his own sweet time about heading there. Once outside, he aimed not for the tide-line rocks, where the otters all lived, but for the higher ground, south. I looked out toward the harbor.

The locals here seem to carry an air of excessive sensuality, a notion that echoes historical observations, like those of Thackeray, who once commented on the behavior and attire of rural Irish women. While I find these musings amusing, John Murphy, a local acquaintance, often dismisses such romantic pursuits as relics of his past. His indifference is a stark contrast to the vibrant energy that pulses through the town. Lately, I've been contemplating selling my property and moving to Cambodia, a prospect that seems more appealing with each passing day. My thoughts, however, are interrupted by Nadia, who bursts in with a frantic account of an otter in the kitchen. True to her coldhearted nature, her panic is more about the disruption than the creature itself. When I investigate, I find the otter calmly lapping up soup, seemingly unperturbed by my presence. After some effort, I manage to shoo it outside, watching as it makes its way to higher ground rather than the usual tide-line rocks. This deviation concerns me, triggering thoughts of potential flooding. I turn to the locals for reassurance, including Bill Knott, who confidently tells me that it hasn't flooded in sixteen years and won\u2019t now. Despite his reassurances, my anxiety lingers, perhaps fueled by the quiet disdain I sense from the townsfolk. They seem to regard me as an outsider, someone who neglects their property and fails to grasp the rhythm of life here. This perception, whether true or imagined, only adds to my growing discontent. The otter incident, the locals' attitudes, and my own restless spirit converge, leaving me more convinced than ever that my future lies elsewhere, perhaps on the serene shores of Cambodia, far from the watchful eyes and whispered judgments of North Galway.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe people of this part of North Galway are oversexed. That is my belief. I had found a level of ribaldry that bordered on the paganistic. It goes back, of course. They lick it up off the crooked rocks. Thackeray, indeed, remarked on the corsetless dress of rural Irish women, and the fact that they kissed perfect strangers in greeting, their vast bosoms swinging. \u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d John Murphy said, \u201clike I\u2019m goin\u2019 to take a lep at the little bitch. My leppin\u2019 days are long fuckin\u2019 over.\u201d If I sold the place for even three-quarters of what I paid for it, I could buy half of Cambodia and do a Colonel fucking Kurtz on it. Lovely, coldhearted Nadia came running from the kitchen. She was as white as the fallen dead. \u201cIs otter!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cIs otter in kitchen!\u201d she cried. He was eating soup when I got there. Carrot and coriander from a ten-gallon pot. Normally, they are terribly skittish, otters, but this fellow was languorous as a surfer. Nervously, I shooed him toward the back door. He took his own sweet time about heading there. Once outside, he aimed not for the tide-line rocks, where the otters all lived, but for the higher ground, south. I looked out toward the harbor. The harbor wall was disappearing beneath spilling sheets of water. I came back into the lounge. \u201cA fucking otter is right,\u201d I said.

The children had returned to him, their mischievous smiles and bright eyes a comforting sight. As they settled on the grass beside him, Sal couldn't help but reflect on his past fears and the feeling of being an outsider that had shadowed much of his life. The memories were vivid, as if they had happened just yesterday. He recalled an incident from his childhood, a moment when he had been laughed at mercilessly for mispronouncing words during a class presentation. The sting of humiliation had stayed with him for years, festering quietly in the corners of his mind. When Sal shared this personal story with Bella and Kamana, he noticed a flicker of understanding in Kamana\u2019s eyes. Kamana, too, had been teased, though for something different\u2014a hole in his shirt that had drawn unwanted attention from his peers. This shared experience created an unspoken bond between them. Sal began reciting difficult words, words that had once tripped him up and left him feeling inadequate. To his delight, Bella and Kamana repeated them back correctly, their young voices clear and confident.

The children had returned to him, their mischievous smiles and bright eyes a comforting sight. As they settled on the grass beside him, Sal couldn't help but reflect on his past fears and the feeling of being an outsider that had shadowed much of his life. The memories were vivid, as if they had happened just yesterday. He recalled an incident from his childhood, a moment when he had been laughed at mercilessly for mispronouncing words during a class presentation. The sting of humiliation had stayed with him for years, festering quietly in the corners of his mind. When Sal shared this personal story with Bella and Kamana, he noticed a flicker of understanding in Kamana\u2019s eyes. Kamana, too, had been teased, though for something different\u2014a hole in his shirt that had drawn unwanted attention from his peers. This shared experience created an unspoken bond between them.

To his delight, Bella and Kamana repeated them back correctly, their young voices clear and confident.

    "paragraph1": "Jane's vigil through the long night, watching Daniel's turned back in the darkness, dissolved into a morning of hollow discoveries and irreversible revelations. The empty space beside her in bed triggered an immediate search through the house, her footsteps echoing against wooden floors and her heart drumming an increasingly anxious rhythm until she reached the fateful bedroom door. There, the scene that greeted her struck with the weight of ancient Greek tragedy: Daniel and Fiona's naked bodies intertwined in sleep, their peaceful expressions a cruel contrast to the turmoil erupting within her chest. The sight burned itself into her memory with the persistence of a branded mark, forcing her to withdraw with the quiet grace of someone who had witnessed something both sacred and profane. The hallway seemed longer on her retreat, each step carrying her further from a reality she had hoped to create and closer to one she never wanted to accept. Outside, the morning sun cast an almost mocking brightness over the scene, where Nigel methodically skimmed the pool's surface, creating ripples that mirrored the disturbances in Jane's emotional waters. His offered companionship, though genuine, bounced off the protective shell she had already begun to form around herself, and her request for a ride home emerged as much from a desire to flee as from practical necessity. The car journey unfolded in a cocoon of silence, with Jane so deeply entrenched in her internal landscape that the external world became a blur of meaningless shapes and colors, effectively erasing the route from her memory \u2013 a subconscious act of self-preservation ensuring she would never retrace these steps to Nigel's house or cross paths with the boys again. The familiar contours of her own home, when finally reached, appeared transformed through the lens of her altered perspective, every familiar object and corner suddenly imbued with an otherworldly quality, as if she had returned to a place that was simultaneously home and not home, known and unknown. The morning's events had created a fissure in her reality, through which even the most mundane aspects of her life now seemed to emit a strange, almost supernatural glow, marking the beginning of a profound disconnection from her previous understanding of love, trust, and belonging. The weight of her unrequited love hung heavy in the air of her home, transforming the space into a museum of what could have been, each room holding echoes of possibilities that would never materialize, while the physical distance she had put between herself and the morning's discovery seemed to only emphasize the emotional chasm that had opened within her. The sunlight streaming through her windows illuminated dust particles dancing in the air, their random movements somehow embodying the chaos she felt inside, while the familiar sounds of her neighborhood \u2013 children playing, cars passing, birds singing \u2013 created a surreal soundtrack to her altered state of consciousness, highlighting how the world continued its normal rhythm even as her personal universe had shifted on its axis.",
    "paragraph2": "When they did go to bed, however, Daniel was suddenly exhausted; stoop-backed, he crawled between the sheets in his underpants, turning away from Jane, toward the window. \u201cWatch over me\u201d was the last thing he mumbled. And so she kept vigil faithfully for hours in the quiet of the night, presiding over the mystery of her changed life, adjusting her body against the peremptory curve of his turned back and legs in the narrow single bed. But at last she couldn\u2019t help it\u2014she fell asleep herself. And when she awoke in the morning Daniel was gone. After a while, when he didn\u2019t come back, she put on her underclothes and her dress, and set off around the house in search of him. Downstairs, she smelled Paddy\u2019s sweat and saw the tousled mess of his hair, poking from the top of a sleeping bag on the sofa in the lounge. Nigel was making a racket outside with the sliding door of the garage, in search of the net for the swimming pool. Jane climbed upstairs again.

It was a beautiful room, like nothing she\u2019d ever seen before, with a pale wood floor and plain white walls, creamy sheepskin rugs. Fresh sunlight, pouring through windows all along its length, was reflected in the mirrored doors of the built-in wardrobes; the curtains, in some kind of rough white translucent linen, were cut too long for the windows, and the cloth fell in heaps on the floor. A huge bed seemed to be all white sheets and no blankets. (Jane had never seen a duvet before.) In the bed, with the duvet kicked to their feet, Daniel and Fiona lay naked and asleep, facing away from each other, their slim tanned legs tangled together. Jane, who had done the Greeks in history, thought that they looked like young warriors in a classical scene, fallen in the place where they had been wrestling. She withdrew from the room without waking them, as quietly as she had come in. Nigel, rather the worse for wear, in his pajama bottoms, was smoking and skimming the pool, dumping the rubbish in a soaking heap beside him. He watched when Jane came to stand at the pool\u2019s brink; she stared in with dry, hot eyes. \u201cSo now you know,\u201d he said.

She asked only if he would drive her home, and he said he\u2019d get the car out as soon as he\u2019d finished with the pool. \u201cI\u2019d like to go now,\u201d she said crisply, sounding like her mother. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d On the way back, they hardly spoke, except when Nigel asked for directions as they drew near the house. Jane forgot, in her absorption, to notice the way they\u2019d come, so that she never afterward knew where she\u2019d been. And she never saw Nigel\u2019s house again, or any of the boys (Fiona once, perhaps, at a party). He dropped her off at the bottom of the drive.

As\u00ed comenz\u00f3 mi largo y extra\u00f1o viaje como editor de Modern Love, hablando cada semana con desconocidos sobre los detalles m\u00e1s \u00edntimos de sus enredos rom\u00e1nticos, familiares y plat\u00f3nicos, y publicando despu\u00e9s sus historias para cientos de miles o incluso millones de lectores. Nunca so\u00f1\u00e9 que seguir\u00eda haciendo este trabajo 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, pero ha sido una carrera maravillosa. Con el tiempo, y con la ayuda de mi colega Miya Lee, Modern Love ha crecido y ahora incluye un p\u00f3dcast, libros, presentaciones en vivo, otra columna semanal, Tiny Love Stories, de 100 palabras y programas de televisi\u00f3n en Estados Unidos, India, Jap\u00f3n y los Pa\u00edses Bajos. Modern Love comenz\u00f3 el mismo a\u00f1o que Facebook, tres a\u00f1os antes que los iPhone, ocho a\u00f1os antes que Tinder y 11 a\u00f1os antes de que el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo fuera legal en todo Estados Unidos.

    "paragraph2": "As I sit here, reflecting on the 20-year journey of the \"Modern Love\" column, I am struck by the serendipity of its inception. It was October 31, 2004, and our debut piece by Steve Friedman shared the pages with news of Yasser Arafat's deteriorating health and the heated U.S. presidential election between George W. Bush and John Kerry. Little did I know that this humble column would grow into a global phenomenon, expanding into a podcast, books, live presentations, a weekly column called \"Tiny Love Stories,\" and television programs in multiple countries. My colleague Miya Lee has been instrumental in this growth, and I'm grateful for her partnership. As I look back, I'm also reminded of the personal journey that has unfolded alongside the column's evolution. I was 41 when we launched, married with two young children, and navigating the challenges of balancing work and family life. Fast forward to today, and I'm 61, separated, and proud of the independent adults my children have become. The \"Modern Love\" column has been a constant in my life, a reminder that love, in all its forms, is a universal language that transcends borders, cultures, and generations. As I celebrate this milestone, I'm filled with gratitude for the privilege of sharing these stories with the world and for the lessons I've learned along the way about love, loss, and the human condition.",

Everything felt precisely placed until their words cut through the air, disrupting the delicate balance I'd been savoring. It bothered me how a simple conversation could diminish something so precious about that moment, leaving me irritated and slightly off-kilter. Yet, as quickly as the annoyance came, it dissolved, replaced by the day's persistent beauty - sunlight dancing on surfaces and the melodic sounds of a little girl splashing in water somewhere nearby. When I touched their hand, I wondered if that fleeting contact marked the beginning of some deeper disturbance I couldn't yet name. The scene shifted two weeks later at the Polinzanos' barbecue, where I found myself grateful for the respite after being buried in a work report. Ralph was in his element that day, manning the grill with unusual enthusiasm and holding court about real estate matters. He couldn't stop criticizing this new house in the neighborhood, going on about its outrageous price tag and what he considered questionable architectural choices.

Was it the first sign of a disturbance that had been growing secretly? Two weeks later the Polinzanos had that barbecue.

    "paragraph1": "A few days later, Li Hanlin came back from his trip. He found Lin Hong sitting on the balcony, indifferent to his homecoming. He laid his bag on the sofa, went over to Lin Hong, and looked at her. She seemed to have been struck dumb. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he said. Lin Hong\u2019s eyes were fixed on the floor. Li Hanlin waited by her side, and when she still said nothing he went over to the sofa, opened his bag, and dumped out the dirty clothes, then looked at her. He was displeased to find her still staring at the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d he said. Lin Hong turned away from him and surveyed the view from the balcony. Li Hanlin went back to rummaging around in his bag. He took out his other belongings and laid them on the sofa. Then he began to lose his temper. He walked over to Lin Hong and started to shout. \u201cWhat the hell is this about? I come home and you put on a sourpuss face. What have I done to offend you now? You\u2014\u201d Li Hanlin stopped abruptly. He could see that a key was clasped between Lin Hong\u2019s finger and thumb. There was a buzzing noise in his head. He stood there a moment, then went to his study and opened a drawer. Some magazines were stacked inside. He groped around underneath the magazines, but failed to find the neatly folded envelope in the right-hand corner. He realized that he was breathing heavily. Li Hanlin stood by the window for a long time. Then he left the room and walked quietly over to Lin Hong. He bent down. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to my office?\u201d Lin Hong sat there motionless. Li Hanlin looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve read Qingqing\u2019s letters?\u201d Lin Hong began to tremble. Li Hanlin hesitated, then put his hand on her shoulder. Lin Hong jerked violently, knocking his hand away. It returned to its original position and hung there for a moment before he put it in his trouser pocket.",

The late afternoon sun cast a golden hue across the room, where Lin Hong sat on the balcony, her figure silhouetted against the fading light. Her posture was rigid, her eyes fixed on the horizon, seemingly oblivious to his presence. Li Hanlin's heart sank at her indifference, a cold reception he hadn't anticipated. He cleared his throat, attempting to break the icy silence with a cheerful greeting, but Lin Hong remained mute, her gaze unwavering and distant. Frustration bubbled within him as he moved to the bedroom, wrestling with the zipper of his travel-worn suitcase. Each item he unpacked was a reminder of his absence and her unspoken resentment. The tension in the room was palpable, an invisible barrier growing between them. Unable to contain his irritation any longer, he stormed onto the balcony, demanding an explanation for her cold demeanor. His voice was sharp, slicing through the air as he asked what was wrong. It was then that he noticed the small, gleaming key nestled in her trembling hand. A bolt of fear shot through him, and he rushed to his study, his heart pounding in his chest. The envelope was missing, confirming his worst fears. The letters from Qingqing, secrets he had hoped to keep hidden, were now exposed. He returned to Lin Hong, his anger mingled with desperation, and confronted her about the discovery. Her trembling increased, and when he reached out to touch her shoulder, she flinched, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. The emotional turmoil was etched on her face, a mirror to the guilt and distress that gnawed at him. Li Hanlin's facade of anger crumbled, revealing the vulnerability beneath. In that silent exchange, amidst the charged atmosphere of unspoken words and raw emotions, both grappled with the unraveling of trust, unsure of what lay ahead for their fractured relationship.",

    "paragraph1": "As Dr. R. K. Smile sat in his opulent office, surrounded by the trappings of a life built on questionable ethics, he couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement at the prospect of a new opportunity. A tip had come his way, whispering of a chance to meet the famous actress, Miss Salma R., a woman whose beauty and talent had captivated the hearts of millions, including that of his poor relation, Quichotte. Dr. Smile's eyes gleamed with anticipation as he thought of the potential benefits this meeting could bring, not just for himself, but for Quichotte, who had been pining for the actress for what felt like an eternity. Quichotte, a man with a heart full of love and a soul full of determination, had traveled across the vast expanse of the United States, from the sun-kissed deserts of the west to the concrete jungle of New York, all in the hopes of catching a glimpse of his beloved Miss Salma R. Now, as he sat in his cramped, dingy hotel room, surrounded by the detritus of a life on the move, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unworthiness, a nagging doubt that he was somehow less than deserving of the actress's attention. It was a feeling that had become all too familiar for Quichotte, one that he had grown accustomed to, but never truly accepted. And so, when a mysterious message arrived from Dr. Smile, requesting a meeting in the heart of Central Park, Quichotte's curiosity was piqued. What could Dr. Smile want with him? What news could he possibly have to share? The questions swirled in Quichotte's mind like a maelstrom, pulling him in with an otherworldly force. As he made his way through the crowded streets of Manhattan, the towering skyscrapers looming above him like giants, Quichotte couldn't shake the feeling that his life was about to change in ways he couldn't yet imagine. The meeting with Dr. Smile was a revelation, a glimpse into a world that Quichotte had only ever caught glimpses of. Dr. Smile, resplendent in his tailored suit and gleaming gold watch, seemed every inch the confident, self-assured man that Quichotte had always known him to be. But as they walked through the park, the sounds of the city fading into the background, Dr. Smile's mask began to slip, revealing a man troubled by the weight of his own making. He spoke of the recent raid on his wife's social gathering, the accusations of corruption that had been leveled against him, and the frustration that had been building inside him like a powder keg. \"I've enriched so many people, Quichotte,\" Dr. Smile exclaimed, his voice rising in indignation. \"I've given them the keys to the kingdom, and this is how they repay me? By betraying me, by turning on me like a pack of wolves?\" Quichotte listened, entranced, as Dr. Smile defended his actions, dismissing the allegations of corruption as nothing more than a cultural norm. \"This is how business is done, Quichotte,\" he said, his eyes glinting with a mixture of defiance and desperation. \"This is how the game is played. And I've played it better than most.\" Despite his bravado, however, Dr. Smile was clearly a man on the ropes, his confidence shaken by the recent turn of events. And yet, even as he spoke of his troubles, there was a hint of something else, a sense that he was holding something back, something",
    "paragraph2": "When a whisper reached him, the faintest murmur from one of his top, inner-circle speakers\u2019-bureau doctors, that a certain Indian movie actress turned American daytime-TV superstar might appreciate a house call, Dr. R. K. Smile actually laughed out loud and clapped his hands. \u201cArr\u00e9, kya baat! \u201d he cried out in the privacy of his home office. \u201cWhoa, what a thing!\u201d Because now, if it all worked out as he hoped, he just might be able to make his poor relation\u2019s impossible dream come true, if only for a moment, before the tragic inevitable occurred. He might find it in his power, and in his heart, to bring fantasy-besotted old Quichotte face to face with his lady love. Quichotte, arriving in Manhattan at the end of a long journey\u2014his quest toward Miss Salma R. had led him through Tulsa, Oklahoma; Beautiful, Kansas; Cleveland, Ohio; Bunyan, Pennsylvania; Chaucer, New Jersey; and Huckleberry, New York\u2014felt like a snail coming out of its shell. Here was bustle and thrum, hustle and flow, everything he had spent the better part of his life recoiling from, concealing himself instead in the heart of the country, leading a small life among other small lives. Now he was back in the big room, at the high rollers\u2019 table, betting the farm on love. He found accommodation in the Blue Yorker hotel, which stood conveniently just a couple of blocks from the tunnel exit, a hundred and three dollars a night, including parking, excellent value, no I.D. demanded, no questions asked, cash money required in advance, and only when he entered his Oriental Delights-themed room did he understand that he was in one of the city\u2019s numerous no-tell motels, with six free porno channels on the TV. There was adjustable mood lighting. There were strategically placed mirrors. The night was full of noises, of pleasure, pain, and painful pleasure. It was hard to sleep soundly. But, in the days that followed, Quichotte was pensive and sad. He stayed in his room watching TV (not the porno channels). He did not go to stand outside Miss Salma R.\u2019s apartment building, or outside her office slash studio, in the hope of glimpsing the woman whose heart he had come to the city to win. \u201cThere is still much to be done before I am worthy of her presence,\u201d he told himself, and then, seemingly, did nothing. The path to the Beloved was closed, even when he was so near to her, and he did not know how to open it. Then, unexpectedly, he received a mysterious series of texts from his cousin and erstwhile employer, asking where he was, seeming unsurprised when he confirmed that he was in New York, and requesting an immediate meeting by an old red-oak tree near the Hans Christian Andersen statue in Central Park. He went to the Park and Dr. Smile was waiting for him. Hat, coat, small leather attach\u00e9 case, like an Old World medico doing his rounds. But there had been a transformation in his state of mind. He was no longer the warm and gleeful man Quichotte remembered. \u201cBest of cousins!\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s walk a little,\u201d Dr. Smile said. His mood, Quichotte noted with regret, was foul. \u201cThere has been an event today in Atlanta,\u201d Dr. Smile said as they walked in the general direction of the boathouse. \u201cA shocking event, may I say. An offensive event concerning my good wife.\u201d \u201cMrs. Happy?\u201d Quichotte cried. \u201cThat is indeed unexpected and woeful news! I hope she has not met with a misfortune?\u201d \u201c \u2018Misfortune\u2019 is too mild a word,\u201d Dr. Smile said grimly. \u201cI will tell you what has happened. I have a need to tell someone, and I believe I can talk to you\u2014because, to put it bluntly, you are nobody, you know nobody, so you can tell nobody who is anybody, and, plus, you are borderline simple as well.\u201d This remark\u2014its tone very unlike the kind manner with which his cousin had always spoken to him\u2014struck Quichotte as harsh and, in part, incorrect. \u201cBut everybody is somebody,\u201d he replied mildly. \u201cAlthough the language can be confusing. When we say that \u2018nobody is here,\u2019 we mean in fact that \u2018somebody\u2019 is \u2018not here.\u2019 If I am here, I can\u2019t be nobody. Look,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cThere, there, there. Somebody, somebody, somebody.\u201d He pointed at himself. \u201cSomebody,\u201d he concluded with pride. Dr. Smile heard him out with growing impatience. \u201cI repeat,\u201d he said, \u201cborderline simple. And I don\u2019t have time for small talk. I have something to say today about the injustice of the world toward a man who is only trying to do his best. And also toward his lady wife, an innocent bystander, Happy by name, happy by nature.

Her sisters were in their thirties, but, like Deborah, they could have been mistaken for college students, wearing jeans and clogs and fisherman sweaters, and her brother Matty, with whom I had danced in a circle at the wedding, was now a freshman at Amherst, with wide-set green eyes and wispy brown hair and a complexion that reddened easily. As soon as I saw Deborah\u2019s siblings, joking with one another as they chopped and stirred things in the kitchen, I was furious with my mother for making a scene before we left the house and forcing me to wear a shalwar kameez.

He asked\u2014not in a supplicating way of course but I would say with reasonable respect\u2014if I could give him a hand in the office. The first special since Mrs. B. has been away. I asked what he wanted me to do. \u201cJust more or less to keep her steady,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s young and she\u2019s not used to it yet. Give your hands a good scrub, too. Use the soap in the bottle in the toilet downstairs.\u201d The patient was lying flat on the examining table with a sheet over her from the waist down. The top part of her was fully dressed in a dark-blue buttoned-up cardigan and a white blouse with a lace-trimmed collar. These clothes lay loosely over her sharp collarbone and nearly flat chest. Her hair was black, pulled tightly back from her face and braided and pinned on top of her head. This prim and severe style made her neck look long and emphasized the regal bone structure of her white face, so that from a distance she could be taken for a woman of forty-five. Close up you could see that she was quite young, probably around twenty. Her pleated skirt was hung up on the back of the door. I could see the rim of white panties that she had thoughtfully hung underneath. She was shivering hard though the office wasn\u2019t cold. \u201cNow, Madeleine,\u201d my father said. \u201cThe first thing is we\u2019ve got to get your knees up.\u201d I wondered if he knew her. Or did he just ask for a name and use whatever the woman gave him? \u201cEasy,\u201d he said. \u201cEasy. Easy.\u201d He got the stirrups in place and her feet into them. She was still wearing her loafers. Her knees shook so much in this new position that they clapped together. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hold steadier than that,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou know, now, I can\u2019t do my job unless you do yours. Do you want a blanket over you?\u201d He said to me, \u201cGet her a blanket. Off the bottom shelf there.\u201d I arranged the blanket to cover the top part of Madeleine\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t look at me. Her teeth rattled. She clenched her mouth shut. \u201cNow, just slide down this way a bit,\u201d my father said. And to me, \u201cHold her knees. Get them apart. Just hold her easy.\u201d I put my hands on the knobs of the girl\u2019s knees and moved them apart as gently as I could. My father\u2019s breathing filled the room with its busy unintelligible comments. I had to hold Madeleine\u2019s knees quite firmly to keep them from jerking together. \u201cWhere\u2019s that old woman?\u201d she said. I said, \u201cShe\u2019s at home. She had a fall. I\u2019m here instead.\u201d So she had been here before. \u201cShe\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. Her voice was matter-of-fact, almost a growl, not so nervous as I would have expected from the agitation of her body. My father had picked up a thin rod like a knitting needle. \u201cNow. This is the hard part,\u201d he said. He spoke in a conversational tone, milder I think than any I have ever heard from him. \u201cAnd the more you tighten up the harder it will be. So just\u2014easy. There. Easy. Good girl. Good girl.\u201d I was trying to think of something to say that would ease her or distract her. I could see now what my father was doing. Laid out on a white cloth on the table beside him he had a series of rods, all of the same length but of a graduated thickness. These were what he would use, one after the other, to open and stretch the cervix. From my station behind the sheeted barrier beyond the girl\u2019s knees, I could not see the actual, intimate progress of these instruments. But I could feel it, from the arriving waves of pain in her body that beat down the spasms of apprehension and actually made her quieter. Where are you from? Where did you go to school? Do you have a job? (I had noticed a wedding ring, but quite possibly they all wore wedding rings.) Do you have any brothers or sisters? Why should she want to answer any of that, even if she weren\u2019t in pain? She sucked her breath back through her teeth and widened her eyes at the ceiling. \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cGetting there,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl. Good quiet girl. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d I said, \u201cI was going to paint this room, but I never got around to it. If you were going to paint it, what color would you choose?\u201d \u201cHoh,\u201d said Madeleine. \u201cHoh.\u201d A sudden startled expulsion of breath. \u201cHoh. Hoh.\u201d \u201cYellow?\u201d I said. \u201cI thought a light yellow. Or a light green?\u201d By the time we got to the thickest rod Madeleine had thrust her head back into the flat cushion, stretching out her long neck, and stretching her mouth, too, lips wide and tight over her teeth. \u201cThink of your favorite movie. What is your favorite movie?\u201d A nurse said that to me, just as I reached the unbelievable interminable plateau of pain and was convinced that relief would not come, not this time. How could movies exist anymore in the world? Now I\u2019d said the same thing to Madeleine and Madeleine\u2019s eyes flicked over me with the coldly distracted expression of someone who sees that a human being can be about as much use as a stopped clock.

    "paragraph2": "As I stood in my father's office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation as he asked for my assistance with a procedure. His usual assistant, Mrs. Barrie, was still recovering from an injury and was unavailable to help, so I had been called in as a last-minute replacement. I had watched my father perform countless medical procedures over the years, but I had never actually participated in one before. My father, a seasoned doctor with years of experience, seemed to sense my hesitation and gave me a reassuring nod as he began to explain the procedure. We were going to be performing a dilation and curettage, a relatively routine procedure, but one that still made me feel a bit uneasy. The patient, a young woman named Madeleine, was already lying on the examination table, her eyes fixed on the ceiling as she tried to calm her racing heart. My father handed me a pair of gloves and instructed me to hold Madeleine's knees steady, which I did, trying to offer her a reassuring smile as I did so.As the procedure began, I couldn't help but notice the look of distress on Madeleine's face. She was shivering and clenching her teeth, her eyes welling up with tears as my father worked. I tried to distract her with conversation, asking her about her interests and hobbies, but she was too caught up in her own pain and discomfort to respond. My father worked quickly and efficiently, his hands moving with a precision that came from years of practice, but even he couldn't hide the look of weariness that had been etched on his face for weeks. It had been a long and difficult few months, with Mrs. Barrie's injury and a heavier-than-usual patient load taking its toll on him. I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt as I watched him work, knowing that I was planning to leave soon, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, and wondering who would be there to help him when I was gone.Despite the difficulties of the procedure, my father worked tirelessly, his focus solely on Madeleine and her well-being. I watched in awe as he expertly navigated the complexities of the human body, his hands moving with a gentle precision that belied the difficulty of the task at hand. As the procedure drew to a close, Madeleine's distress began to subside, replaced by a look of relief and exhaustion. My father smiled wearily and patted her hand, offering her words of comfort and reassurance as he helped her sit up and begin the slow process of recovery. As I watched, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for my father, who had dedicated his life to helping others, often at great personal cost.As the procedure came to an end and Madeleine was helped off the examination table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. It had been a difficult and trying experience, but we had gotten through it, and Madeleine was on the road to recovery. My father smiled wearily and thanked me for my help, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he did so. I smiled back, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment at having been able to assist him, even if it was just in a small way. As we cleaned up the examination room and prepared for the next patient, I couldn't help but think about the future, and the possibilities that lay ahead. I had always known that I wanted to leave, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, but now I wasn't so sure. My father needed me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was abandoning him by leaving.",

As she filled the pages of her sketchbook, she couldn't help but chuckle at the quirks and foibles of her fellow writers, and she began to realize that sometimes the most telling stories are the ones told without words.\n\nParagraph 2:\nOnce, she and Martha had gone to Greece together, to an international writers\u2019 conference. While they were there, she\u2019d renounced writing. Instead, she made sketches in a sketchbook and titled it \u201cThe Glass of Water,\u201d as if that were what everyone was looking for, a glass of water in Greece, not a different kind of novel or some not-stupid sentences. The sketches were a bit cartoonish but loving. We see the glass of water disappearing up the stairs with a Russian poet. Or gripped fast by a Turkish Cypriot novelist (who has poured it into two glasses). Or lost by a Spanish writer behind a mountain of toast at the breakfast table. She found toast difficult to draw convincingly, from a side view. Drawing the Peruvian poet, on the other hand, who claimed to have videotaped his llama drinking from the glass of water, was a joy, as she already knew how to draw llamas. The videotape was mostly blank. Meanwhile, the former Nobel Prize winner from Ireland had seen the glass of water being hoisted (by Samuel Beckett in a bar), and there was no pronoun for that, he kept saying. The Serbian poet fell off the bus. He got no sympathy. He never drank water!\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

    "paragraph1": "During a typical Sunday lunch, my mother and I found ourselves in the midst of a conversation that veered from the mundane to the unexpectedly intriguing, with our discussion centering on a recent burglary at my home. As we sat at the dining table, the familiar aroma of roasted chicken and potatoes wafting through the air, my mother, ever the skeptic, expressed her deep-seated distrust of locksmiths. She posited that the burglar might have had some knowledge of old optical equipment, given the peculiar items that were stolen. Her eyes twinkled with a mix of concern and excitement, an unusual combination that hinted at her secret delight in applying her extensive crime novel knowledge to a real-life scenario. She suggested that I take a trip to the local flea market, notoriously known as the \"Thieves' Market,\" to see if any of my stolen items might turn up there. It was a place she had heard about from her friend Rita, who had gained a reputation for helping people recover their stolen belongings without expecting anything in return. Intrigued by the prospect, I listened as my mother recounted Rita's story. Rita, once a victim of burglary herself, had turned her misfortune into a mission, dedicating her time to assisting others in similar predicaments. Her altruistic efforts were fueled by her understanding of the despair that accompanied losing treasured possessions, and she found solace in the camaraderie that the market fostered among those who had been wronged. As we continued our conversation, Rita's motivations became clearer. She believed that the market served a vital role in the community, not just as a place to potentially reclaim lost items but as a beacon of hope for those left in the wake of theft. The market, she explained, was intensely local, with many of the sellers and buyers hailing from nearby neighborhoods. It was this proximity that made it an effective venue for recovering stolen goods, as it provided a direct link between the victims and the possible conduits of their misplaced belongings. Rita's perspective extended beyond the market itself, touching on broader themes of community and the gradual erosion of societal structures. She shared an article she had recently read, which explored the idea of civilizations breaking down into smaller, more manageable groups.

Certainly, she said, they must have a copy of every single key to every single lock they\u2019d ever installed, or a magic key to all doors, and they entered people\u2019s homes to steal small items whose absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed for a while; worse, perhaps the locksmiths didn\u2019t steal anything, just took naps on beds that weren\u2019t theirs, drank out of people\u2019s favorite cups, shit in their toilets. Only other locksmiths ever had a clue. \u201cIn your case, though, it\u2019s not a locksmith who did the deed,\u201d my mother said. \u201cObviously. We\u2019re looking at someone who knows about old optical equipment. Did you tell the police that?\u201d My mother was glad about the burglary, in a way. She got to use all the knowledge that she\u2019d gleaned from reading crime novels for the past forty years. \u201cMaybe a former optometrist,\u201d she said, blowing her nose and folding the Kleenex neatly over the result. \u201cOr a failed one.\u201d Her building had implemented a new waste-sorting policy the previous month, and we\u2019d mostly been talking about that, so my burglary provided a welcome change of topic, at least.

My mother doubted a lot. The gray bin was always full. \u201cI can put you in touch with my friend Rita for next week,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next week?\u201d \u201cWell, like, every Sunday, honey, there\u2019s the flea market on Pinto Square.\u201d \u201cAnd why would I go there with your friend Rita?\u201d I\u2019d never heard of Rita. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know about this!\u201d my mother said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s been burglarized goes to Pinto Square to see if their things resurface. People call it the Thieves\u2019 Market. You never heard that? China, lamps, small furniture\u2014lots of stolen property ends up there. I\u2019m surprised the cop who filed your complaint didn\u2019t tell you to go there first thing.\u201d \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t look desperate enough to get my stuff back,\u201d I said. And I wasn\u2019t.

She\u2019d had a bad fall a few years earlier, and since then she\u2019d decided to limit her outings to what was strictly necessary, a category that didn\u2019t include socializing. Rita said that she was an \u201capartment therapist,\u201d which didn\u2019t help me imagine how they might\u2019ve met. My mother didn\u2019t even believe in therapy for people. Rita had told me to bring pictures of the stolen items, but I\u2019d never taken pictures of things, never really taken pictures in general, so I\u2019d pulled images of similar objects from the Internet and printed them at the office. \u201cI guess these will work,\u201d Rita said, and she sat on the ground to cut the images out and tape them (she carried scissors and tape in her purse) into a notebook deformed by dozens of other similar pasteups. My mother had told me that Rita had started coming to the market after having been burglarized herself, years before, and that, giving up on finding her own things, she\u2019d realized she knew how to navigate the place, and could be of help to the newly burglarized. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d I asked Rita. \u201cShould I pay you for every Sunday you spend looking, or only when you find something?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t your mom tell you?\u201d she said. \u201cI do this for free.\u201d Free things make me suspicious. \u201cNow, you\u2019re probably thinking a free service can\u2019t possibly be worth much,\u201d Rita said. \u201cBut I\u2019m actually pretty selfish in doing this.

As we sat at the dining table, the familiar aroma of roasted chicken and potatoes wafting through the air, my mother, ever the skeptic, expressed her deep-seated distrust of locksmiths. She posited that the burglar might have had some knowledge of old optical equipment, given the peculiar items that were stolen. Her eyes twinkled with a mix of concern and excitement, an unusual combination that hinted at her secret delight in applying her extensive crime novel knowledge to a real-life scenario. She suggested that I take a trip to the local flea market, notoriously known as the \"Thieves' Market,\" to see if any of my stolen items might turn up there. It was a place she had heard about from her friend Rita, who had gained a reputation for helping people recover their stolen belongings without expecting anything in return. Intrigued by the prospect, I listened as my mother recounted Rita's story. Rita, once a victim of burglary herself, had turned her misfortune into a mission, dedicating her time to assisting others in similar predicaments. Her altruistic efforts were fueled by her understanding of the despair that accompanied losing treasured possessions, and she found solace in the camaraderie that the market fostered among those who had been wronged. As we continued our conversation, Rita's motivations became clearer. She believed that the market served a vital role in the community, not just as a place to potentially reclaim lost items but as a beacon of hope for those left in the wake of theft. The market, she explained, was intensely local, with many of the sellers and buyers hailing from nearby neighborhoods. It was this proximity that made it an effective venue for recovering stolen goods, as it provided a direct link between the victims and the possible conduits of their misplaced belongings. Rita's perspective extended beyond the market itself, touching on broader themes of community and the gradual erosion of societal structures. She shared an article she had recently read, which explored the idea of civilizations breaking down into smaller, more manageable groups. This concept resonated with her, as she saw the market as a microcosm of this phenomenon\u2014a small, self-sustaining community that arose from the ashes of broader societal collapse. By the time our lunch plates had been cleared, I felt a curious blend of unease and optimism. The notion that my stolen items might be lurking somewhere within the bustling stalls of the \"Thieves' Market\" was both unsettling and strangely hopeful.

The final administrative task fell to Ailo, the registered nurse whose signature would make Eric's death official, transforming personal tragedy into public record. Through it all, Juliet remained composed, though her thoughts often returned to their last morning together, when love and history had intertwined in their bed, unaware that their own story was about to become another tale of loss at sea.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

I learned to swim, and my grandfather died of a malignant tumor. That\u2019s all.\u201d We sat for a moment staring out at the twilight and then stood up. Time had been suspended as he talked, but now it resumed. \u201cTime to go home.\u201d At the sound of his father\u2019s voice, the boy opened his eyes.

A bigger town, closer to the mountains.\u201d The boy ran over to him, and he took his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to say goodbye to the cafeteria.\u201d On the other side of the window, the kitchen was slowly vanishing, as if sinking into a swamp. \u201cI hope there\u2019s a nice one in your new town,\u201d I said. He smiled without nodding. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said. The boy waved to Juju, and the pompom on his cap shook. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d I waved, too. They walked off in the fading light. Juju and I stood watching them until they became a tiny point in the distance and then vanished. I suddenly wanted to read my \u201cGood night\u201d telegram one more time.

He had just finished recounting a long, winding tale that had held me spellbound, and I felt an overwhelming urge to convey something to him, to bridge the gap between us before his face disappeared into the shadows. The boy, who had been lying on Juju, our faithful canine companion, was roused by his father's voice, signaling that it was time for them to take their leave. As the boy sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, the man and I delved into a discussion about the conclusion of his story, which had revolved around the themes of learning to swim and the poignant loss of his grandfather. Our conversation was tinged with a sense of melancholy, and as we prepared to part ways, the man mentioned that he would be moving to a new town, prompting a heartfelt farewell exchange. I watched, transfixed, as the man and boy walked away from me, their silhouettes gradually diminishing until they vanished into the distance. As I stood there, feeling the weight of their departure, I was suddenly seized by an inexplicable urge to revisit a \"Good night\" telegram I had sent earlier, to relive the sense of connection it had brought me. And then, without warning, I turned and ran in the opposite direction, Juju bounding alongside me, the night air rushing past us like a dark, endless river.",

I wanted to tell him something, so much that it felt like a weight on my chest. If I didn\u2019t, it seemed that his face might actually disappear. \u201cIs that the end of the story?\u201d I said, taking great care with each word. \u201cIt is.\u201d He gave a slight shake to the hair on his forehead. \u201cBut what happened with your swimming class and the cafeteria?\u201d \u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell. I learned to swim, and my grandfather died of a malignant tumor. That\u2019s all.\u201d We sat for a moment staring out at the twilight and then stood up. Time had been suspended as he talked, but now it resumed. \u201cTime to go home.\u201d At the sound of his father\u2019s voice, the boy opened his eyes. He blinked for a moment, as if trying to recapture his dream. Juju\u2019s tail wagged, rubbing against the child\u2019s cheek. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll see you here again,\u201d I said, taking Juju\u2019s chain in my hand. \u201cWe move on to a new area tomorrow. A bigger town, closer to the mountains.\u201d The boy ran over to him, and he took his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to say goodbye to the cafeteria.\u201d On the other side of the window, the kitchen was slowly vanishing, as if sinking into a swamp. \u201cI hope there\u2019s a nice one in your new town,\u201d I said. He smiled without nodding. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said. The boy waved to Juju, and the pompom on his cap shook. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d I waved, too. They walked off in the fading light. Juju and I stood watching them until they became a tiny point in the distance and then vanished. I suddenly wanted to read my \u201cGood night\u201d telegram one more time. I could feel the exact texture of the paper, see the letters, feel the air of the night it had arrived. I wanted to read it over and over, until the words melted away. Tightening my grip on the chain, I began to run in the opposite direction.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs the evening surrendered to the all-encompassing darkness of night, I found myself fixated on the man's face, illuminated only by the faint, flickering light that seemed to dance across his features. He had just finished recounting a long, winding tale that had held me spellbound, and I felt an overwhelming urge to convey something to him, to bridge the gap between us before his face disappeared into the shadows. The boy, who had been lying on Juju, our faithful canine companion, was roused by his father's voice, signaling that it was time for them to take their leave. As the boy sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, the man and I delved into a discussion about the conclusion of his story, which had revolved around the themes of learning to swim and the poignant loss of his grandfather. Our conversation was tinged with a sense of melancholy, and as we prepared to part ways, the man mentioned that he would be moving to a new town, prompting a heartfelt farewell exchange. I watched, transfixed, as the man and boy walked away from me, their silhouettes gradually diminishing until they vanished into the distance. As I stood there, feeling the weight of their departure, I was suddenly seized by an inexplicable urge to revisit a \"Good night\" telegram I had sent earlier, to relive the sense of connection it had brought me. And then, without warning, I turned and ran in the opposite direction, Juju bounding alongside me, the night air rushing past us like a dark, endless river.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

But at home in Minnesota, where she has spent most of her life, friends and political observers describe her as the coolheaded and ultracompetent counterpart to a man known for an intuitive and charismatic political style. \u201cWe have always worked as a partnership,\u201d Ms. Walz, 58, told the self-improvement podcast \u201cWhat If It Works\u201d last month, later adding, \u201cWe are still one another\u2019s closest advisers.\u201d Ms. Walz did not comment for this article. The first gubernatorial spouse in Minnesota to keep an office in the state capital, Ms. Walz regularly advises her husband and has used her platform to advance policy initiatives, most significantly around offering college degree programs to inmates. Raised in the tiny farming town of Ivanhoe, Minn., only a 15-minute drive from South Dakota\u2019s eastern border, Ms. Walz is the daughter of schoolteachers, and the eldest of four sisters. Ms. Walz was a caretaker in the family, according to her youngest sister, Heidi Ohlmann. \u201cShe\u2019s always looking out for everyone,\u201d Ms. Ohlmann said in an interview.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

My mother shared her general suspicion of locksmiths. Certainly, she said, they must have a copy of every single key to every single lock they\u2019d ever installed, or a magic key to all doors, and they entered people\u2019s homes to steal small items whose absence wouldn\u2019t be noticed for a while; worse, perhaps the locksmiths didn\u2019t steal anything, just took naps on beds that weren\u2019t theirs, drank out of people\u2019s favorite cups, shit in their toilets. Only other locksmiths ever had a clue. \u201cIn your case, though, it\u2019s not a locksmith who did the deed,\u201d my mother said. \u201cObviously. We\u2019re looking at someone who knows about old optical equipment. Did you tell the police that?\u201d My mother was glad about the burglary, in a way. She got to use all the knowledge that she\u2019d gleaned from reading crime novels for the past forty years. \u201cMaybe a former optometrist,\u201d she said, blowing her nose and folding the Kleenex neatly over the result. \u201cOr a failed one.\u201d Her building had implemented a new waste-sorting policy the previous month, and we\u2019d mostly been talking about that, so my burglary provided a welcome change of topic, at least. Just as I was thinking this, though, my mother asked which bin used tissues should go in. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering for days,\u201d she said. \u201cCan snot be recycled?\u201d \u201cWhen in doubt, throw it in the gray bin,\u201d I said. My mother doubted a lot. The gray bin was always full. \u201cI can put you in touch with my friend Rita for next week,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next week?\u201d \u201cWell, like, every Sunday, honey, there\u2019s the flea market on Pinto Square.\u201d \u201cAnd why would I go there with your friend Rita?\u201d I\u2019d never heard of Rita. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know about this!\u201d my mother said. \u201cEveryone who\u2019s been burglarized goes to Pinto Square to see if their things resurface. People call it the Thieves\u2019 Market. You never heard that? China, lamps, small furniture\u2014lots of stolen property ends up there. I\u2019m surprised the cop who filed your complaint didn\u2019t tell you to go there first thing.\u201d \u201cI guess I didn\u2019t look desperate enough to get my stuff back,\u201d I said. And I wasn\u2019t.

Rita said that she was an \u201capartment therapist,\u201d which didn\u2019t help me imagine how they might\u2019ve met. My mother didn\u2019t even believe in therapy for people. Rita had told me to bring pictures of the stolen items, but I\u2019d never taken pictures of things, never really taken pictures in general, so I\u2019d pulled images of similar objects from the Internet and printed them at the office. \u201cI guess these will work,\u201d Rita said, and she sat on the ground to cut the images out and tape them (she carried scissors and tape in her purse) into a notebook deformed by dozens of other similar pasteups. My mother had told me that Rita had started coming to the market after having been burglarized herself, years before, and that, giving up on finding her own things, she\u2019d realized she knew how to navigate the place, and could be of help to the newly burglarized. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d I asked Rita. \u201cShould I pay you for every Sunday you spend looking, or only when you find something?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t your mom tell you?\u201d she said. \u201cI do this for free.\u201d Free things make me suspicious. \u201cNow, you\u2019re probably thinking a free service can\u2019t possibly be worth much,\u201d Rita said. \u201cBut I\u2019m actually pretty selfish in doing this.

    "paragraph2": "During a typical Sunday lunch, my mother and I found ourselves in the midst of a conversation that veered from the mundane to the unexpectedly intriguing, with our discussion centering on a recent burglary at my home. As we sat at the dining table, the familiar aroma of roasted chicken and potatoes wafting through the air, my mother, ever the skeptic, expressed her deep-seated distrust of locksmiths. She posited that the burglar might have had some knowledge of old optical equipment, given the peculiar items that were stolen. Her eyes twinkled with a mix of concern and excitement, an unusual combination that hinted at her secret delight in applying her extensive crime novel knowledge to a real-life scenario. She suggested that I take a trip to the local flea market, notoriously known as the \"Thieves' Market,\" to see if any of my stolen items might turn up there. It was a place she had heard about from her friend Rita, who had gained a reputation for helping people recover their stolen belongings without expecting anything in return. Intrigued by the prospect, I listened as my mother recounted Rita's story. Rita, once a victim of burglary herself, had turned her misfortune into a mission, dedicating her time to assisting others in similar predicaments. Her altruistic efforts were fueled by her understanding of the despair that accompanied losing treasured possessions, and she found solace in the camaraderie that the market fostered among those who had been wronged. As we continued our conversation, Rita's motivations became clearer. She believed that the market served a vital role in the community, not just as a place to potentially reclaim lost items but as a beacon of hope for those left in the wake of theft. The market, she explained, was intensely local, with many of the sellers and buyers hailing from nearby neighborhoods. It was this proximity that made it an effective venue for recovering stolen goods, as it provided a direct link between the victims and the possible conduits of their misplaced belongings. Rita's perspective extended beyond the market itself, touching on broader themes of community and the gradual erosion of societal structures. She shared an article she had recently read, which explored the idea of civilizations breaking down into smaller, more manageable groups. This concept resonated with her, as she saw the market as a microcosm of this phenomenon\u2014a small, self-sustaining community that arose from the ashes of broader societal collapse. By the time our lunch plates had been cleared, I felt a curious blend of unease and optimism. The notion that my stolen items might be lurking somewhere within the bustling stalls of the \"Thieves' Market\" was both unsettling and strangely hopeful. My mother's enthusiasm for the mystery at hand, coupled with Rita's inspiring story, left me contemplating not only the fate of my possessions but also the resilience of communities in the face of adversity. As I sat there, digesting both my meal and the weighty topics we had delved into, I realized that this unexpected conversation had opened my eyes to the intricate web of human connections that often go unnoticed, but which can provide comfort and support in times of need.",

    "paragraph1": "As I stood in my father's office, I couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation as he asked for my assistance with a procedure. His usual assistant, Mrs. Barrie, was still recovering from an injury and was unavailable to help, so I had been called in as a last-minute replacement. I had watched my father perform countless medical procedures over the years, but I had never actually participated in one before. My father, a seasoned doctor with years of experience, seemed to sense my hesitation and gave me a reassuring nod as he began to explain the procedure. We were going to be performing a dilation and curettage, a relatively routine procedure, but one that still made me feel a bit uneasy. The patient, a young woman named Madeleine, was already lying on the examination table, her eyes fixed on the ceiling as she tried to calm her racing heart. My father handed me a pair of gloves and instructed me to hold Madeleine's knees steady, which I did, trying to offer her a reassuring smile as I did so.As the procedure began, I couldn't help but notice the look of distress on Madeleine's face. She was shivering and clenching her teeth, her eyes welling up with tears as my father worked. I tried to distract her with conversation, asking her about her interests and hobbies, but she was too caught up in her own pain and discomfort to respond. My father worked quickly and efficiently, his hands moving with a precision that came from years of practice, but even he couldn't hide the look of weariness that had been etched on his face for weeks. It had been a long and difficult few months, with Mrs. Barrie's injury and a heavier-than-usual patient load taking its toll on him. I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt as I watched him work, knowing that I was planning to leave soon, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, and wondering who would be there to help him when I was gone.Despite the difficulties of the procedure, my father worked tirelessly, his focus solely on Madeleine and her well-being. I watched in awe as he expertly navigated the complexities of the human body, his hands moving with a gentle precision that belied the difficulty of the task at hand. As the procedure drew to a close, Madeleine's distress began to subside, replaced by a look of relief and exhaustion. My father smiled wearily and patted her hand, offering her words of comfort and reassurance as he helped her sit up and begin the slow process of recovery. As I watched, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for my father, who had dedicated his life to helping others, often at great personal cost.As the procedure came to an end and Madeleine was helped off the examination table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. It had been a difficult and trying experience, but we had gotten through it, and Madeleine was on the road to recovery. My father smiled wearily and thanked me for my help, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he did so. I smiled back, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment at having been able to assist him, even if it was just in a small way. As we cleaned up the examination room and prepared for the next patient, I couldn't help but think about the future, and the possibilities that lay ahead. I had always known that I wanted to leave, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, but now I wasn't so sure. My father needed me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was abandoning him by leaving.",

Use the soap in the bottle in the toilet downstairs.\u201d The patient was lying flat on the examining table with a sheet over her from the waist down. The top part of her was fully dressed in a dark-blue buttoned-up cardigan and a white blouse with a lace-trimmed collar. These clothes lay loosely over her sharp collarbone and nearly flat chest. Her hair was black, pulled tightly back from her face and braided and pinned on top of her head. This prim and severe style made her neck look long and emphasized the regal bone structure of her white face, so that from a distance she could be taken for a woman of forty-five. Close up you could see that she was quite young, probably around twenty. Her pleated skirt was hung up on the back of the door. I could see the rim of white panties that she had thoughtfully hung underneath. She was shivering hard though the office wasn\u2019t cold. \u201cNow, Madeleine,\u201d my father said. \u201cThe first thing is we\u2019ve got to get your knees up.\u201d I wondered if he knew her. Or did he just ask for a name and use whatever the woman gave him? \u201cEasy,\u201d he said. \u201cEasy. Easy.\u201d He got the stirrups in place and her feet into them. She was still wearing her loafers. Her knees shook so much in this new position that they clapped together. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hold steadier than that,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou know, now, I can\u2019t do my job unless you do yours. Do you want a blanket over you?\u201d He said to me, \u201cGet her a blanket. Off the bottom shelf there.\u201d I arranged the blanket to cover the top part of Madeleine\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t look at me. Her teeth rattled. She clenched her mouth shut. \u201cNow, just slide down this way a bit,\u201d my father said. And to me, \u201cHold her knees. Get them apart. Just hold her easy.\u201d I put my hands on the knobs of the girl\u2019s knees and moved them apart as gently as I could. My father\u2019s breathing filled the room with its busy unintelligible comments. I had to hold Madeleine\u2019s knees quite firmly to keep them from jerking together. \u201cWhere\u2019s that old woman?\u201d she said. I said, \u201cShe\u2019s at home. She had a fall. I\u2019m here instead.\u201d So she had been here before. \u201cShe\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. Her voice was matter-of-fact, almost a growl, not so nervous as I would have expected from the agitation of her body. My father had picked up a thin rod like a knitting needle. \u201cNow. This is the hard part,\u201d he said. He spoke in a conversational tone, milder I think than any I have ever heard from him. \u201cAnd the more you tighten up the harder it will be. So just\u2014easy. There. Easy. Good girl. Good girl.\u201d I was trying to think of something to say that would ease her or distract her. I could see now what my father was doing. Laid out on a white cloth on the table beside him he had a series of rods, all of the same length but of a graduated thickness. These were what he would use, one after the other, to open and stretch the cervix. From my station behind the sheeted barrier beyond the girl\u2019s knees, I could not see the actual, intimate progress of these instruments. But I could feel it, from the arriving waves of pain in her body that beat down the spasms of apprehension and actually made her quieter. Where are you from? Where did you go to school? Do you have a job? (I had noticed a wedding ring, but quite possibly they all wore wedding rings.) Do you have any brothers or sisters? Why should she want to answer any of that, even if she weren\u2019t in pain? She sucked her breath back through her teeth and widened her eyes at the ceiling. \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cGetting there,\u201d my father said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl. Good quiet girl. Won\u2019t be long now.\u201d I said, \u201cI was going to paint this room, but I never got around to it. If you were going to paint it, what color would you choose?\u201d \u201cHoh,\u201d said Madeleine. \u201cHoh.\u201d A sudden startled expulsion of breath. \u201cHoh. Hoh.\u201d \u201cYellow?\u201d I said. \u201cI thought a light yellow. Or a light green?\u201d By the time we got to the thickest rod Madeleine had thrust her head back into the flat cushion, stretching out her long neck, and stretching her mouth, too, lips wide and tight over her teeth. \u201cThink of your favorite movie. What is your favorite movie?\u201d A nurse said that to me, just as I reached the unbelievable interminable plateau of pain and was convinced that relief would not come, not this time. How could movies exist anymore in the world? Now I\u2019d said the same thing to Madeleine and Madeleine\u2019s eyes flicked over me with the coldly distracted expression of someone who sees that a human being can be about as much use as a stopped clock. I risked taking one hand off her knee and touched her han",

His usual assistant, Mrs. Barrie, was still recovering from an injury and was unavailable to help, so I had been called in as a last-minute replacement. I had watched my father perform countless medical procedures over the years, but I had never actually participated in one before. My father, a seasoned doctor with years of experience, seemed to sense my hesitation and gave me a reassuring nod as he began to explain the procedure. We were going to be performing a dilation and curettage, a relatively routine procedure, but one that still made me feel a bit uneasy. The patient, a young woman named Madeleine, was already lying on the examination table, her eyes fixed on the ceiling as she tried to calm her racing heart. My father handed me a pair of gloves and instructed me to hold Madeleine's knees steady, which I did, trying to offer her a reassuring smile as I did so.As the procedure began, I couldn't help but notice the look of distress on Madeleine's face. She was shivering and clenching her teeth, her eyes welling up with tears as my father worked. I tried to distract her with conversation, asking her about her interests and hobbies, but she was too caught up in her own pain and discomfort to respond. My father worked quickly and efficiently, his hands moving with a precision that came from years of practice, but even he couldn't hide the look of weariness that had been etched on his face for weeks. It had been a long and difficult few months, with Mrs. Barrie's injury and a heavier-than-usual patient load taking its toll on him. I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt as I watched him work, knowing that I was planning to leave soon, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, and wondering who would be there to help him when I was gone.Despite the difficulties of the procedure, my father worked tirelessly, his focus solely on Madeleine and her well-being. I watched in awe as he expertly navigated the complexities of the human body, his hands moving with a gentle precision that belied the difficulty of the task at hand. As the procedure drew to a close, Madeleine's distress began to subside, replaced by a look of relief and exhaustion. My father smiled wearily and patted her hand, offering her words of comfort and reassurance as he helped her sit up and begin the slow process of recovery. As I watched, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for my father, who had dedicated his life to helping others, often at great personal cost.As the procedure came to an end and Madeleine was helped off the examination table, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. It had been a difficult and trying experience, but we had gotten through it, and Madeleine was on the road to recovery. My father smiled wearily and thanked me for my help, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he did so. I smiled back, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment at having been able to assist him, even if it was just in a small way. As we cleaned up the examination room and prepared for the next patient, I couldn't help but think about the future, and the possibilities that lay ahead. I had always known that I wanted to leave, to pursue my own dreams and ambitions, but now I wasn't so sure. My father needed me, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was abandoning him by leaving.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTonight he knocked on my door. He knocked though it wasn\u2019t all the way closed. I was reading. He asked\u2014not in a supplicating way of course but I would say with reasonable respect\u2014if I could give him a hand in the office. The first special since Mrs. B. has been away.

    "paragraph1": "Samsa found a dressing gown his size in the closet of the largest room. It looked like something he might be able to manage. He hadn\u2019t a clue what to do with the other clothes\u2014how to put them on, how to wear them. They were just too complicated: too many buttons, for one thing, and he was unsure how to tell front from back, or top from bottom. Which was supposed to go on the outside, and which underneath? The dressing gown, on the other hand, was simple, practical, and quite free of ornament. Its light, soft cloth felt good against his skin, and its color was dark blue. He even turned up a matching pair of slippers. He pulled the dressing gown over his naked body and, after much trial and error, succeeded in fastening the belt around his waist. He looked at himself in the mirror, clad now in gown and slippers. This was certainly better than walking around naked. It wasn\u2019t as warm as it might have been, to be sure, but as long as he remained indoors it would stave off the cold. Best of all, he no longer had to worry that his soft skin would be exposed to vicious birds. When the doorbell rang, Samsa was dozing in the biggest room (and in the biggest bed) in the house. It was warm under the feather quilts, as cozy as if he were sleeping in an egg. He woke from a dream. He couldn\u2019t remember it in detail, but it had been pleasant and cheerful. The bell echoing through the house, however, yanked him back to cold reality. He dragged himself from the bed, fastened his gown, put on his dark-blue slippers, grabbed his black walking stick, and, hand on railing, tottered down the stairs. It was far easier than it had been on the first occasion. Still, the danger of falling was ever present. He could not afford to let down his guard. Keeping a close eye on his feet, he picked his way down the stairs one step at a time, as the doorbell continued to ring. Whoever was pushing the buzzer had to be a most impatient and stubborn person. Walking stick in his left hand, Samsa approached the front door. He twisted the knob to the right and pulled, and the door swung in. A little woman was standing outside. A very little woman. It was a wonder she was able to reach the buzzer. When he looked more closely, however, he realized that the issue wasn\u2019t her size. It was her back, which was bent forward in a perpetual stoop. This made her appear small, though, in fact, her frame was of normal dimensions. She had fastened her hair with a rubber band to prevent it from spilling over her face. The hair was a deep chestnut and very abundant. She was dressed in a battered tweed jacket and a full, loose-fitting skirt that covered her ankles. A striped cotton scarf was wrapped around her neck. She wore no hat. Her shoes were of the tall lace-up variety, and she appeared to be in her early twenties. There was still something of the girl about her. Her eyes were big, her nose small, and her lips twisted a little to one side, like a skinny moon. Her dark eyebrows formed two straight lines across her forehead, giving her a skeptical look.",
    "paragraph2": "In the quiet solitude of his room, Samsa lay nestled within the comforting embrace of a large, cozy bed, the kind that seems to cradle one in dreams, with soft layers that could almost lull a person back to sleep even in the midst of wakefulness. The air was still, and the early morning light filtered gently through the curtains, casting a serene glow over the simple furnishings. Dressed in a dark blue dressing gown and matching slippers, Samsa found solace in the uncomplicated attire, a choice that offered ease and familiarity amidst the complexities of daily life. The simple fabric felt smooth against his skin, a welcome alternative to the often cumbersome and intricate clothing he typically avoided. Yet, the tranquility of the morning was abruptly shattered by the persistent ringing of the doorbell, a sound that cut through the silence with unyielding insistence. It was this noise, echoing persistently through the house, that roused Samsa from his drowsy state, urging him to rise from the comfort of his bed. With a sigh, he reached for his walking stick, a steadfast companion that not only provided physical support but a sense of security as he navigated the challenges of mobility. Carefully, he maneuvered himself out of bed, each movement deliberate and measured to avoid the danger of falling, a constant concern in his daily routine. The journey to the door was not a swift one, but Samsa approached it with patience, descending the stairs with cautious steps, the tap of his walking stick marking his progress. Upon reaching the door, he paused briefly, steadying himself before turning the handle and opening it to reveal the world beyond. There, on the doorstep, stood a young woman, her presence both unexpected and intriguing. Her posture was stooped, a subtle curvature that lent her an appearance of smallness despite the average proportions of her frame. Her hair, a rich chestnut hue, caught the light in a way that accentuated its natural warmth, cascading around her shoulders in gentle waves. She wore a tweed jacket, its texture adding an air of sophistication to her ensemble, paired with a loose skirt that moved softly with the breeze. The combination of her attire and demeanor presented a curious blend of youthful vibrancy and mature wisdom. Her eyes, however, held a skeptical expression, a look that suggested she approached the world with a questioning gaze, probing beneath the surface of things. It was a look that could both challenge and engage, demanding attention and reflection. As Samsa stood before her, he took in these details, each one painting a vivid picture of the visitor who had interrupted his morning. Her presence hinted at stories untold, mysteries wrapped in the everyday fabric of life, and as they exchanged greetings, Samsa was drawn into the subtle complexities of their encounter, his curiosity piqued by the unexpected blend of characteristics she embodied. In that moment, the ordinary act of answering the door became a doorway to possibilities, a reminder of the rich tapestry of human interaction and the unpredictable nature of the world outside his door.",

There, on the doorstep, stood a young woman, her presence both unexpected and intriguing. Her posture was stooped, a subtle curvature that lent her an appearance of smallness despite the average proportions of her frame. Her hair, a rich chestnut hue, caught the light in a way that accentuated its natural warmth, cascading around her shoulders in gentle waves. She wore a tweed jacket, its texture adding an air of sophistication to her ensemble, paired with a loose skirt that moved softly with the breeze. The combination of her attire and demeanor presented a curious blend of youthful vibrancy and mature wisdom. Her eyes, however, held a skeptical expression, a look that suggested she approached the world with a questioning gaze, probing beneath the surface of things. It was a look that could both challenge and engage, demanding attention and reflection. As Samsa stood before her, he took in these details, each one painting a vivid picture of the visitor who had interrupted his morning. Her presence hinted at stories untold, mysteries wrapped in the everyday fabric of life, and as they exchanged greetings, Samsa was drawn into the subtle complexities of their encounter, his curiosity piqued by the unexpected blend of characteristics she embodied. In that moment, the ordinary act of answering the door became a doorway to possibilities, a reminder of the rich tapestry of human interaction and the unpredictable nature of the world outside his door.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

If you want to know the truth, she\u2019s lower-class, Roy, and I\u2019m sorry to have to say it\u2014\u201d I\u2019m not about to argue the point. The fact is I tried everything I could to talk Allison out of going through with this\u2014finally, to my shame, falling back on the same argument about the whole \u00dcbermensch-Untermensch dynamic that Connie used on me\u2014but Allison merely gave me a bitter smile and said, \u201cI trust your genes, Roy. You don\u2019t have to be involved. I just want to do this, that\u2019s all. For myself. And for nature. You believe in nature, don\u2019t you?\u201d You don\u2019t have to be involved. But I was involved, though we\u2019d had sex only the one time (or two, actually, counting the night I brought her the pupkit), and if she had a boy and he looked like me and grew up right next door playing with our daughter, how involved would that be? So there comes a day, sometime during that eighth month, a Tuesday, when I\u2019m working at home and Connie\u2019s at the office, and I\u2019m so focussed on the problem at hand that I keep putting off my bathroom break until the morning\u2019s nearly gone. That\u2019s the way it always is when I\u2019m deeply engaged with a problem, a kind of mind-body separation, but finally the body\u2019s needs prevail and I push myself up from my desk to go down the hall to the bathroom. I\u2019m standing there, in mid-flow, when I become aware of the sound of a dog barking on the front lawn and I shift my torso ever so slightly so that I can glance out the window and see what the ruckus is all about. It\u2019s the red dog, the Cherry Pit that set all this in motion, and it\u2019s tearing around on my hybrid lawn, chasing something.",
    "paragraph2": "As I sit here, surrounded by the quiet chaos of my home, I'm reminded of the intricate web of relationships that has become my life. My partner, Connie, is pregnant, and I couldn't be more thrilled - or so I thought, until our neighbor, Allison, announced she was also expecting. The irony isn't lost on Connie, who finds the situation endlessly amusing, often making lighthearted comments about Allison's growing belly, completely unaware of the complicated history between us. I try to laugh along with her, but it's a forced smile, a desperate attempt to conceal the turmoil brewing inside me. You see, I've known Allison for a while, and our relationship has always been... complicated. When she first told me she was considering having a child, I tried to dissuade her, citing all the reasons why it wasn't the right time, but she was resolute. She had her reasons, personal and deeply rooted, and I couldn't sway her, no matter how hard I tried. Now, as I watch her waddle around her yard, a constant reminder of my own impending fatherhood, I'm forced to confront the consequences of my actions. It's days like today, when I'm working from home, that I get lost in my thoughts. I spent the morning deeply engrossed in my work, the hours ticking by in a blur, until my bladder finally protested, forcing me to take a break. As I stood in the bathroom, staring blankly out the window, I noticed a commotion on my lawn - the Cherry Pit, a rambunctious little dog with a penchant for trouble, was causing a scene. My heart sank as I watched it dig up the grass, its antics transporting me back to the events that led us to this point. It was the Cherry Pit, after all, that had brought Allison and me together, our shared concern for its well-being sparking a connection that would eventually lead to... well, to this. I sighed, feeling the weight of my secrets bearing down on me, and wondered how I'd managed to get myself into this mess. As I stood there, frozen in thought, the Cherry Pit looked up, its big brown eyes meeting mine, and for a moment, I felt like it was the only one who truly understood the complexity of my situation.",

I play dumb, of course\u2014what else can I do? \u201cMaybe she went to GenLab,\u201d I say. \u201cHer? You\u2019re kidding me, right? I mean, look at that string of jerks she keeps dating. If you want to know the truth, she\u2019s lower-class, Roy, and I\u2019m sorry to have to say it\u2014\u201d I\u2019m not about to argue the point. The fact is I tried everything I could to talk Allison out of going through with this\u2014finally, to my shame, falling back on the same argument about the whole \u00dcbermensch-Untermensch dynamic that Connie used on me\u2014but Allison merely gave me a bitter smile and said, \u201cI trust your genes, Roy. You don\u2019t have to be involved. I just want to do this, that\u2019s all. For myself. And for nature. You believe in nature, don\u2019t you?\u201d You don\u2019t have to be involved. But I was involved, though we\u2019d had sex only the one time (or two, actually, counting the night I brought her the pupkit), and if she had a boy and he looked like me and grew up right next door playing with our daughter, how involved would that be? So there comes a day, sometime during that eighth month, a Tuesday, when I\u2019m working at home and Connie\u2019s at the office, and I\u2019m so focussed on the problem at hand that I keep putting off my bathroom break until the morning\u2019s nearly gone. That\u2019s the way it always is when I\u2019m deeply engaged with a problem, a kind of mind-body separation, but finally the body\u2019s needs prevail and I push myself up from my desk to go down the hall to the bathroom. I\u2019m standing there, in mid-flow, when I become aware of the sound of a dog barking on the front lawn and I shift my torso ever so slightly so that I can glance out the window and see what the ruckus is all about. It\u2019s the red dog, the Cherry Pit that set all this in motion, and it\u2019s tearing around on my hybrid lawn, chasing something.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAs I sit here, surrounded by the quiet chaos of my home, I'm reminded of the intricate web of relationships that has become my life. My partner, Connie, is pregnant, and I couldn't be more thrilled - or so I thought, until our neighbor, Allison, announced she was also expecting. The irony isn't lost on Connie, who finds the situation endlessly amusing, often making lighthearted comments about Allison's growing belly, completely unaware of the complicated history between us. I try to laugh along with her, but it's a forced smile, a desperate attempt to conceal the turmoil brewing inside me. You see, I've known Allison for a while, and our relationship has always been... complicated. When she first told me she was considering having a child, I tried to dissuade her, citing all the reasons why it wasn't the right time, but she was resolute. She had her reasons, personal and deeply rooted, and I couldn't sway her, no matter how hard I tried. Now, as I watch her waddle around her yard, a constant reminder of my own impending fatherhood, I'm forced to confront the consequences of my actions. It's days like today, when I'm working from home, that I get lost in my thoughts. I spent the morning deeply engrossed in my work, the hours ticking by in a blur, until my bladder finally protested, forcing me to take a break. As I stood in the bathroom, staring blankly out the window, I noticed a commotion on my lawn - the Cherry Pit, a rambunctious little dog with a penchant for trouble, was causing a scene. My heart sank as I watched it dig up the grass, its antics transporting me back to the events that led us to this point. It was the Cherry Pit, after all, that had brought Allison and me together, our shared concern for its well-being sparking a connection that would eventually lead to... well, to this. I sighed, feeling the weight of my secrets bearing down on me, and wondered how I'd managed to get myself into this mess. As I stood there, frozen in thought, the Cherry Pit looked up, its big brown eyes meeting mine, and for a moment, I felt like it was the only one who truly understood the complexity of my situation.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

They were two guests who had lived in their shared courteousness for so long that they had mistaken it for affection or warmth. But even two guests living together for fifty years would have some secrets between them. Perhaps Bella could have understood them intuitively had she been their blood child. In her own marriages\u2014the first had lasted twelve years, the second five\u2014Bella had fared poorly as host to her husband-guests. Your problem, Peter had said after the second divorce, is that you don\u2019t take yourself seriously. I saw your eyes when you were walking down the aisle. They snickered even though you kept your face straight. With Paul? Bella asked. Both times, Peter said. What do women do when they can\u2019t take themselves seriously? Bella asked. That\u2019s not a question I can answer, Peter said. She wished he hadn\u2019t taken the liberty of giving her a diagnosis without offering a cure. Both her ex-husbands had called her toxic. She had to respect them for that and for not wanting to stay on and be poisoned. She would have respected Peipei, too, if she had outgrown her obsession with Mr. Wu. Over the years, Bella had successfully maintained the right distance between Mr. Wu and herself: too close, and Peipei would have felt jealous; too removed, Peipei would have felt slighted on behalf of her husband. If only Peipei could have an affair. Or, better, divorce her husband, and send him tumbling back to the pool of commoners. But she held on to the marriage with a kind of fairy-tale loyalty. What would Mr. Wu think of this passion which refused to die? Obsession that has outlived youth must be poison, too.",

They were two guests who had lived in their shared courteousness for so long that they had mistaken it for affection or warmth. But even two guests living together for fifty years would have some secrets between them. Perhaps Bella could have understood them intuitively had she been their blood child. In her own marriages\u2014the first had lasted twelve years, the second five\u2014Bella had fared poorly as host to her husband-guests. Your problem, Peter had said after the second divorce, is that you don\u2019t take yourself seriously. I saw your eyes when you were walking down the aisle. They snickered even though you kept your face straight. With Paul? Bella asked. Both times, Peter said. What do women do when they can\u2019t take themselves seriously? Bella asked. That\u2019s not a question I can answer, Peter said. She wished he hadn\u2019t taken the liberty of giving her a diagnosis without offering a cure. Both her ex-husbands had called her toxic. She had to respect them for that and for not wanting to stay on and be poisoned. She would have respected Peipei, too, if she had outgrown her obsession with Mr. Wu. Over the years, Bella had successfully maintained the right distance between Mr. Wu and herself: too close, and Peipei would have felt jealous; too removed, Peipei would have felt slighted on behalf of her husband. If only Peipei could have an affair. Or, better, divorce her husband, and send him tumbling back to the pool of commoners. But she held on to the marriage with a kind of fairy-tale loyalty. What would Mr. Wu think of this passion which refused to die? Obsession that has outlived youth must be poison, too.\n\nParagraph 2:\nSitting alone with her thoughts, Bella contemplates the intricate web of relationships that have shaped her life, beginning with her adoptive parents' fifty-year marriage that now seems more like an exercise in politeness than genuine love.

The late afternoon sun cast a golden hue across the room, where Lin Hong sat on the balcony, her figure silhouetted against the fading light. Her posture was rigid, her eyes fixed on the horizon, seemingly oblivious to his presence. Li Hanlin's heart sank at her indifference, a cold reception he hadn't anticipated. He cleared his throat, attempting to break the icy silence with a cheerful greeting, but Lin Hong remained mute, her gaze unwavering and distant. Frustration bubbled within him as he moved to the bedroom, wrestling with the zipper of his travel-worn suitcase. Each item he unpacked was a reminder of his absence and her unspoken resentment. The tension in the room was palpable, an invisible barrier growing between them. Unable to contain his irritation any longer, he stormed onto the balcony, demanding an explanation for her cold demeanor. His voice was sharp, slicing through the air as he asked what was wrong. It was then that he noticed the small, gleaming key nestled in her trembling hand. A bolt of fear shot through him, and he rushed to his study, his heart pounding in his chest. The envelope was missing, confirming his worst fears. The letters from Qingqing, secrets he had hoped to keep hidden, were now exposed. He returned to Lin Hong, his anger mingled with desperation, and confronted her about the discovery. Her trembling increased, and when he reached out to touch her shoulder, she flinched, her eyes brimming with unshed tears. The emotional turmoil was etched on her face, a mirror to the guilt and distress that gnawed at him. Li Hanlin's facade of anger crumbled, revealing the vulnerability beneath.

The waitress, who had been intently studying her freshly manicured nails, finally acknowledged their presence with a cursory nod and gestured toward the bar area before vanishing behind a heavy velvet curtain. Their presence in this questionable establishment was just another step in their carefully planned journey together, having decided to cohabitate only after methodically ensuring they were compatible in all major aspects of life. The transition hadn't been simple; both had explored job opportunities in each other's cities, but ultimately, John's position as a financial analyst in New York proved more practical than Sarah's work as a pottery instructor in Boston. As she prepared for the move, Sarah had kept him updated with a steady stream of texts \u2013 snapshots of her increasingly empty apartment, lists of items she was donating to avoid duplicates in their shared space, and the bittersweet process of dismantling her independent life to build something new together.\n\nParagraph 2:\nAt the restaurant, he gave the woman a look of his own. This look said two things: one, you worry too much, and, two, this is fun\u2014I\u2019m having fun, now you have fun. The woman was having fun, but she also didn\u2019t want to get food poisoning. As if having read her mind, the man said, If you do get sick, you can blame me. Eventually, the waitress noticed that the couple had arrived. She had been picking polish off her nails. She looked up but didn\u2019t get up and instead waved them to the bar. Sit anywhere you like, she said sleepily. Then she disappeared behind a black curtain embroidered with the Chinese character for the sun.

My partner, Connie, is pregnant, and I couldn't be more thrilled - or so I thought, until our neighbor, Allison, announced she was also expecting. The irony isn't lost on Connie, who finds the situation endlessly amusing, often making lighthearted comments about Allison's growing belly, completely unaware of the complicated history between us. I try to laugh along with her, but it's a forced smile, a desperate attempt to conceal the turmoil brewing inside me. You see, I've known Allison for a while, and our relationship has always been... complicated. When she first told me she was considering having a child, I tried to dissuade her, citing all the reasons why it wasn't the right time, but she was resolute. She had her reasons, personal and deeply rooted, and I couldn't sway her, no matter how hard I tried. Now, as I watch her waddle around her yard, a constant reminder of my own impending fatherhood, I'm forced to confront the consequences of my actions. It's days like today, when I'm working from home, that I get lost in my thoughts. I spent the morning deeply engrossed in my work, the hours ticking by in a blur, until my bladder finally protested, forcing me to take a break. As I stood in the bathroom, staring blankly out the window, I noticed a commotion on my lawn - the Cherry Pit, a rambunctious little dog with a penchant for trouble, was causing a scene. My heart sank as I watched it dig up the grass, its antics transporting me back to the events that led us to this point. It was the Cherry Pit, after all, that had brought Allison and me together, our shared concern for its well-being sparking a connection that would eventually lead to... well, to this. I sighed, feeling the weight of my secrets bearing down on me, and wondered how I'd managed to get myself into this mess. As I stood there, frozen in thought, the Cherry Pit looked up, its big brown eyes meeting mine, and for a moment, I felt like it was the only one who truly understood the complexity of my situation.",

Andrew Dessler, who directs climate research at Texas A&M University, notes with concern that one party's primary agenda revolves around continued fossil fuel production, evidenced by their platform's conspicuous omission of climate change while advocating for increased oil, gas, and coal extraction. This approach stands in sharp contrast to Mr. Biden's comprehensive climate strategy, which encompasses aggressive emission reduction targets and a coordinated transition to renewable energy sources across all government agencies.

    "paragraph2": "Despite being launched several months ago, Apple's Vision Pro faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of quality apps available for the device. Major apps like YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, Instagram, and DoorDash are noticeably absent, largely due to corporate competition and a lack of developer confidence. Companies such as Google and Meta, who have their own virtual reality ambitions, show hesitation in supporting Apple's product, fearing it may bolster a competitor in a rapidly evolving market. Developers are equally cautious, reluctant to invest time and resources into creating apps for a platform that has yet to see substantial user adoption, as evidenced by the meager 2,000 apps developed so far. Compounding the issue, Apple has been slow to expand its own content offerings for the Vision Pro. The company has released a few immersive videos through Apple TV, including a prehistoric nature film and a rehearsal video of Alicia Keys and her band, designed to showcase the device's impressive high-definition graphics and spatial audio capabilities. While these videos represent some of the best experiences currently available on the Vision Pro, they are insufficient to compensate for the lack of third-party app support. The combination of these factors presents a considerable hurdle for Apple as it seeks to establish the Vision Pro as a dominant force in the virtual reality market.",

Several months after its debut, there\u2019s still no native YouTube or Netflix app. There\u2019s no Spotify, no Instagram, no DoorDash. (You can still use some of these services in a web browser, or use unofficial third-party apps, but it\u2019s a worse experience.) Some of these apps are missing because of corporate infighting.
